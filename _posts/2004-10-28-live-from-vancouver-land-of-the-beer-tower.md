<p>
so, here i am in vancouver meeting with the bryght guys - super bloggers that they are, and i haven't made a single entry (been here since monday). read on for a brief recap.

<p>
<strong>monday</strong>: i arrived hassle free in the early afternoon. <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/">roland</a> met me at the airport, it was cold and raining, as it should be in vancouver. i got checked into the hotel, where i later established my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkah/1094320/">mobile office</a> . then we headed to <a href="http://www.vaneats.com/reviews/restaurants/brioche">brioche</a> for some yummy food. that was followed with a tour of the prestigious bryght offices, and then off for an early evening.

</p><p>
<strong>wednesday</strong>: we more or less worked all day today. though we did have lunch (and dinner) with the very entertaining <a href="http://anarkystic.com/blog/">andy "termie" smith</a>.
</p><p>
the rest of the week looks to be at least as busy, since tomorrow the <a href="http://www.civicspacelabs.org/">civicspace</a> gang gets to town and our <a href="http://dev.bryght.com/t/wiki/DinnerWithDriesAndCivicSpaceDevelopers">big dinner</a> happens friday. i'll try to post a bit more consistently.
