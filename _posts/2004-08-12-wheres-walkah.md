i'm still here. sandi and i took the kids on a bit of a last minute, ad hoc vacation to my mom's place in <a href="http://www.rockportusa.com/">Rockport, MA</a>.

we had an absolutely awesome time! the weather was gorgeous and it felt really good to get away (as much as i could anyway). but, things were pretty hectic before we left so i didn't say anything here first or tell some people that i was going. so if you've been wondering where the heck i've been, that's where.

pictures are forthcoming, but first i've got a bunch of stuff to catch up on. welcome back, me.
