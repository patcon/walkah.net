<p>I happen to think <a href="http://last.fm/">last.fm</a> is one of the best social sites on the 'net. I love the way it stays out of the way - requires very little interaction from me and it <em>gives me</em> recommendations in return: artists, albums and even concerts.</p>
<p>Recently, my favourite "tool" for last.fm, <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/iScrobbler">iScrobbler</a>,released <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/iScrobbler/forum/35555/_/134630">version 2.0</a>. There are lots of new features, but the coolest I have to say is:</p>
<blockquote>Full Radio support (played through iTunes).</blockquote>
<p>What that means is you can use <a href="http://www.last.fm/listen">last.fm radio</a> from iTunes (so, usual iTunes behaviour still applies). As someone who is frequently away from his entire music collection... I love that.</p>
