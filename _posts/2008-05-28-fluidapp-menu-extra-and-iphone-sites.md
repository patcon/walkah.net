<p><img src="http://walkah.net/sites/walkah.net/files/RTM.png" alt="RTM MenuExtra SSB" />My <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/fluid-desktop-web-apps">love affair</a> with <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid.app</a> continues. The latest release (0.9.1.4) includes support for running your SSB as a <a href="http://fluidapp.com/blog/2008/05/14/menuextra-ssbs-preview/">Menu Extra</a> (i.e. something in the OS X  (check out the <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/itod/videos/6/">video</a>).</p>
<p>As shown in the video, I think the best use for this new feature is in conjunction with iPhone sites. In the video, Tod shows creating an app for http://i.brightkite.com/. I've been using this to check-in on <a href="http://brightkite.com">BrightKite</a>. It's nice, unobtrusive and easy in lieu of BrightKite's own, native desktop apps.</p>
<p>My other favorite (pictured) is http://i.rememberthemilk.com/. Remember the Milk's iPhone app has a nice feature that the "Today" tasks list also shows overdue tasks (which I haven't figured out how to do in the standard web app).</p>
<p>More and more of my webapp usage is moving to fluid these days. I can't say enough good things about this app. And <a href="http://fluidapp.com/blog/2008/05/28/fluid-nightly-with-google-gears/">google gears support</a> is coming!!</p>
