for a while now, i've been on a kick to move toward more graphical computing environments. i no longer use <a href="http://mutt.org/">mutt</a> to read my email on a regular basis and i even occasionally use osx finder or *gasp* nautilus under <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">gnome</a>. one thing i hadn't addressed yet was irc. i use irc a lot for co-ordinating with others on projects, etc. therefore, i like my irc to be 'always on'. this has meant using <a href="http://www.irssi.org/">irssi</a> inside <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/screen.html">gnu screen</a>. for a while, i've been contemplating running an irc proxy so i can experiment with other gui irc clients. until i found this:

<a href="http://irssi.org/?page=docs&doc=proxy">irssi proxy</a>. this allows my currently running irssi + screen to simply act as a proxy for other clients. very cool!! so now, i've got the best of both worlds. 

you also may notice (from the screenshot) that i'm now running <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">fedora core 1</a> on my main workstation instead of <a href="http://www.debian.org/">debian</a>. more on that later...
