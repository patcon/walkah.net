<!--timestamp:1051124400:-->

the leafs lost. they didn't just lose... they got blown out. it was depressing, and now both of my teams are out.  but, as if that wasn't bad enough, andrew was up several times during the night vomiting. he seems better today, though we kept him home from school.  so last night sucked. but, at least it's over.
