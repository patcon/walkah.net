Happy Valentine's Day everyone! I case you hadn't heard, <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0">Drupal 6.0</a> has finally been released! It's been just over a year since our last major release and, while it feels sort of like an eternity, there is a *ton* of great stuff in this new release.

I'm really proud to have helped contribute <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID support</a> (relying party) to this release - the first step in a larger plan to put (keep?) Drupal at the front of the digital identity curve. Those interested in hearing more, check out <a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/openid-and-identity-drupal-future-usermodule">my OpenID session at DrupalCon</a>.

There's a ton of other great new stuff in 6: Update module (if you haven't used <a href="http://drupal.org/project/update_status">update status</a> in Drupal 5 - you should), revamped i18n support, and Drag 'n' Drop everywhere (<a href="http://quicksketch.org/">Nate</a>, you're a rockstar)!

Drupal, be mine. :-*
