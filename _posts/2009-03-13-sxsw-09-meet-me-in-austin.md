In a few short hours, I'll be on a plane to Austin, TX for another edition of [SXSW Interactive](http://sxsw.com/interactive). I'm looking forward to connecting with a bunch of folks that I don't otherwise get to see often. Here's a list of things I'm hoping to catch (in addition to the on-schedule panels):

 * [Activity Streams meetup](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2126462/) - looking forward to diving into more DiSo :-)
 * [XMPP/Jabber Meetup](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2122123/) - I *still* believe that XMPP is one of the most important protocols moving forward on the 'net. Looking forward to syncing back up with this community.
 * [OMB Meetup](http://controlyourself.ca/2009/03/11/control-yourself-at-sxsw/) - I'm excited to help bring [OpenMicroBlogging](http://openmicroblogging.org/) to Drupal via the [Knight Initiative](http://groups.drupal.org/node/14953).

I'll also definitely be at the party that [Lullabot](http://www.lullabot.com/) is co-sponsoring : [32bit](http://twitter.com/32bit).

If you're in Austin for the next few days - ping me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/walkah) or [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/walkah).

Off to finish packing :-)
