<p>
430+ attendees. 5 sessions. 4 days. One hell of a time.
</p>
<p>
I have to say, I might be addicted. The post-drupal conference mixture of utter exhaustion (plus jetlag) and renewed energy and excitement is a feeling that I've really grown to look forward to twice a year. This is one great community full of great people. i love you all!</p>
<p>My personal highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having my son, Andrew, along- definitely mitigated some of the usual homesickness and was hopefully an experience he'll cherish as long as I do.</li>
<li>My socks! I love 'em - and they made <a href="http://drupal4hu.com/">chx</a> jealous :)</li>
<li>Seeing Dries, Gabor, Bert, Adrian, and all the other non-north american drupal folks that I feel like I never get to see enough of</li>
<li>Hanging out with the amazing team from <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/">Lullabot</a>: you're rockstars, each and every one.</li>
<li>A great venue and superb planning - hats off to <a href="http://drupal.cat/">Robert Garrigos</a> and crew!</li>
<li>All the amazing energy behind image/file handling, OOP and other awesome stuff to come in Drupal 7</li>
</ul>
<p>As <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/barcelona">promised</a>, I gave 3 presentations... all of which went well (I thought):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://barcelona2007.drupalcon.org/node/531">OpenID: it's in core... now what?</a>. Another variation on my OpenID theme. <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/">Boris</a> wanted more discussion on directions - but we're still educating, IMO. We'll get there, Boris, promise! (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/walkah/2007-barcelona-drupalcon-openid">slides</a> | <a href="http://walkah.net/sites/walkah.net/files/2007-barcelona-drupalcon-openid.pdf">pdf</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://barcelona2007.drupalcon.org/node/533">	Image handling in core... for real this time.</a>: Possibly my favourite session. Lots of good energy and good discussion - and already some subsequent action. I'll definitely be posting more on this topic! (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/walkah/2007-barcelona-drupalcon-image-handling">slides</a> | <a href="http://walkah.net/sites/walkah.net/files/2007-barcelona-drupalcon-image.pdf">pdf</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://barcelona2007.drupalcon.org/node/532">Drupal and SimpleXML</a>: This session was fun, and better received than I'd expected. I'm not the only one excited by PHP5! (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/walkah/2007-barcelona-drupalcon-drupal-and-simplexml">slides</a> | <a href="http://walkah.net/sites/walkah.net/files/2007-barcelona-drupalcon-simplexml.pdf">pdf</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to those three, I also took part in a couple of panels: the <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/podcast-47-live-barcelona">live podcast</a> was a lot of fun - go check it out!</p>
<p>I was also on the <a href="http://barcelona2007.drupalcon.org/node/442">Drupal Association panel</a>. This was interesting - it was clear that as a young organization - we still have a lot to learn and a lot to do. I was sympathetic to the concerns raised, but there has been a lot of discussion amongst association members since the panel and hopefully we'll see some positive changes forthcoming.</p>
<p>*phew* ok, that's enough for now... although I've left out a bunch. Jetlag calls... g'night planet drupal!</p>
