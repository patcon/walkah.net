<p>
just a quick update from stuttgart to say things are going quite well here. so far we've met some really great people in <a href="http://www.ilabra.org/" title="Ivan Labra">Ivan</a> and <a href="http://www.exposur3.com/" title="Chris Rynearson">Chris</a> , and the work-related aspects have been going exceptionally well (see <a href="http://www.bryght.com/blog/boris-mann/open-source-in-stuttgart" title="Boris on bryght.com">Boris' post</a> for some more details).
</p><p>
although we've been keeping fairly crazy hours, and eating sporadically we have had some very good meals. german food (at least what I've been exposed to) seems to consist of beer, meat, cheese and pretzels. i've also been exposed to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkah/18752876/" title="mouth pockets">maultaschen</a> (which literally translates to "mouth pockets").
</p><p>
in a really nice departure from my last two trips (to <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/back-from-belgium">belgium</a> and <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/php-quebec-conference-recap">montreal</a>), i actually got a chance to do a bit of sight-seeing today. thanks in very large part to <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/" title="the boris mann">Boris'</a> relatives Manfred and Gertrud here in Stuttgart, I got to get out and see some things and take some pictures.
</p><p>
keep an eye on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkah/tags/stuttgart/" title="walkah stuttgart pictures">stuttgart tag</a> (at flickr) for all the pictures.
