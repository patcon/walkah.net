been a while since i gave an andrew hockey update. well, this past weekend marked his first foray into the fabulous world of goaltending. since his league is fundamentally about development, each kid gets a weekend to be goalie (with pads and everything). this past weekend was andrew's turn. i must say, he made me quite proud. he has good instincts in terms of positioning and was as aggressive as i've ever seen him in anything athletic. he even had an absolutely adorable, yet quite good stance. the best part, though, was that he absolutely loved it!

a chip off the old block i must say :) i haven't started a goalie equipment savings fund quite yet, however.
