from <a href="http://weblogs.about.com/od/weblogsoftwareandhosts/tp/topblogtool2004.htm" title="Top 10 Weblog Tools in 2004">about.com</a>:
</p><blockquote>
It took me a while to appreciate Drupal as a blogging + content management system. It just seems too technical and clunky at times. Once I've gotten over the initial hurdles, I realized that this is one terrific weblog tool.

i'd like to think that blogapi.module had a little bit to do with that vote... but maybe not.

one problem though, it looks like <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/" title="ecto">ecto</a> somehow didn't make the top 10. i'd call that a gross oversight.
