so, it's not just my blog that gets neglected. it's also been over 3 months since i knocked off a <a href="http://gallery.sf.net/">gallery</a> task.  i've spent some time (a couple minutes here and there) getting familiar with the codebase all over again. G2 is gonna be a great product, there's a lot of really neat stuff going on in there. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/task.php?func=detailtask&project_task_id=87551&group_id=7130&group_project_id=14056">the task</a> that i completed is fairly mundane, but it feels good to contribute to a great project. my hope is to start carving out more regular chunks of time to contribute. that way, i'll be able to take on some of the more interesting tasks.
