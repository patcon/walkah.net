<p>I've been meaning to post about this for a while, but in a couple weeks I'm headed back to Vancouver to present at the <a href="http://vancouver.php.net/php_conference">Vancouver PHP Conference</a>, February 12th and 13th. I'll actually be giving two talks (back to back even): the first will be a joint presentation with <a href="http://www.sxip.com/">SXIP</a> on <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> going through background and explanation and also looking at PHP code for openid (maybe even some <a href="http://drupal.org/project/openid">drupal code</a> ;). The second presentation - just me, sorry - will be an introduction to drupal development. Not to give anything away, but there may just be pants involved.</p>
<p>I should also note that fellow <a href="http://www.bryght.com/">bryght guy</a> and drupal ninja, <a href="http://www.acko.net/">Steven Wittens</a>, will be presenting. But, if that's not enough, there will also be some other PHP developers you may have heard of giving talks like <a href="http://lerdorf.com/bio.php">Rasmus</a>, <a href="http://derickrethans.nl/">Derick Rethans</a> and more - check the <a href="http://vancouver.php.net/confschedule">schedule</a> for the complete list. Now, go <a href="http://vancouver.php.net/register">register</a>.</p>
