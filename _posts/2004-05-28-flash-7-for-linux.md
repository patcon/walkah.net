so, if you use linux on your desktop (as i do) and frequent sites that use a lot of flash (as i do), then you'd probably be happy to know (as i was) that macromedia released <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/proom/pr/2004/flashplayer_linux.html">flash player 7 for linux</a> yesterday. so, since i am currently running <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">fedora core 2</a> on my desktop i ran over and grabbed the <a href="http://sluglug.ucsc.edu/macromedia/site_ucsc.html">new rpms</a>.

all i can say is performance is <strong>much</strong> better!
