<p>Last night marked (I'm pretty sure), the largest ever attendance at our monthly Drupal User Group meetings. I'd just like to send out another huge public thanks to everyone that showed up. If we keep growing it looks like we'll soon exceed capacity at our beloved <a href="http://linuxcaffe.ca/">Linuxcaffe</a>... a problem I'm hoping we have soon :) Thanks also to <a href="http://baheyeldin.com/">Khalid</a> of <a href="http://2bits.com/">2bits</a> who braved the 401 in from Waterloo to give a nice presentation <a href="http://2bits.com/articles/presentation-building-drupal-sites-using-cck-views-and-panels.html">building drupal sites with cck, views and panels</a>. </p>
<p>For those who may be interested, we're in the process of ramping up planning for the next DrupalCampToronto. We're looking for space (ideally for 100-150 people) over two days - May 11 & 12, 2007. Anyone interested in helping to plan, organize and/or present please get on the <a href="http://lists.openject.com/listinfo/drupalcamptorontoadmin">organizers mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks again everyone - see you all next month!</p>
