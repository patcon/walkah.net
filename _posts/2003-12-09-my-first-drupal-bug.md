so, my first drupal bug (one assigned to me anyway) has come and gone. <a href="http://drupal.org/node/view/4192">this bug</a> is now fixed. in doing so, <a href="http://www.natrak.net">kjartan</a> and i came up with a couple other bugs or things otherwise needing fixing in the module.
the net result of all this is that i know have a (perhaps brief) renewed interest in xmlrpc based blogging. since my free trial of netnewswire (non-lite) has expired, and i wasn't crazy about it's blog posting inteface, i'm still on the hunt for a free (preferably as in speech, not beer) blogging tool for osx.
