<p>well, after what felt like an eternity the much anticipated <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-4.7.0">drupal 4.7 release</a> is officially out. so, to all of you who keep asking ... the answer to "when will 4.7 be out?" is *today*. </p>

<p>this is certainly the biggest release for <a href="http://drupal.org/">drupal</a> during my time in the community. there are certainly too many people who have put in too much great work to try and single them out here. But certainly <a href="http://buytaert.net/">Dries</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/227">Gerhard</a> deserve mention. you guys rock socks.</p>

<p>sadly, rather than having a big celebration party... i know have a mad rush of things to do to get my <a href="http://drupal.org/project/user/1535">contrib modules</a> cleaned up and officially released, as well as working on or 4.7 offering from <a href="http://www.bryght.com/">bryght</a> offering. feel free to fire the hate mail away, but the answer is "yes, it's coming". :)</p>

<p>oh, and I know "we" don't do release names, but my vote is : Drupal 4.7 "Mayday! Mayday!".</p>
