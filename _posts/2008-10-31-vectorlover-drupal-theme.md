![vectorlover](http://walkah.net/sites/walkah.net/files/vectorlover-thumb.png)Earlier this week I gave a free workshop for [PHUG](http://workshops.phug.ca/) here in Toronto. We had a lot of fun and our scheduled one hour turned into 3 or 4 (oops!). I had a lot of fun with the group and the night received [good reviews](http://phug.ca/workshops/index.php/drupal/drupal-workshop-rocked).

During the evening, we took a pure HTML and CSS design and converted it into a Drupal theme. The design is called [VectorLover](http://www.styleshout.com/templates/preview/VectorLover1-0/index.html) - freely available from [styleshout.com](http://www.styleshout.com/).

I took some time this week to clean up our work, and am making "VectorLover" available for download [here](http://walkah.net/sites/walkah.net/files/vectorlover.zip). Please [contact me](http://walkah.net/contact) if you have any questions or comments. Enjoy!

(Note: Due to the [license](http://www.styleshout.com/about.php#license), this theme will not appear in the Drupal repository. Sorry!)
