<p>
those of you who know me (or have ever talked to me) know that I have a major techno-crush on <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">apple's powermac g5</a>. well, <a href="http://www.jasonkrogh.com/" title="Jason Krogh">jason</a> finally succumbed to the urge and bough a new dual 2ghz g5. then, this morning, i find out that even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" title="Linus Torvalds">linus</a> has one (from <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/0,39023165,39183867,00.htm">zdnet</a>):

"My main machine these days is a dual 2GHz G5 (aka PowerPC 970) - it's physically a regular Apple Mac, although it obviously only runs Linux, so I don't think you can call it a Mac any more ;)"
