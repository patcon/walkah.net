Congrats to the full team on another fine release! At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I do wish I had more time to contribute to the gallery project than I do... but lately I've been limited to working on the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/gallery" title="drupal gallery2 integration">drupal integration</a> and, of course, using it for my personal photos <a href="http://walkah.net/gallery" title="walkah's gallery">here</a>. But the good news is, the other folks have been hard at work!

</p><blockquote>
This is the second installment in the Gallery 2 beta cycle. In the past 5 weeks we've made considerable improvements to the product. We're one step closer to having a final product. As with the beta-1 release, we are now providing a well tested upgrade path from here until the final Gallery release. If you're using Gallery 2 Alpha 4 or more recent, you can upgrade without losing any of your data.

go get it now! :)
