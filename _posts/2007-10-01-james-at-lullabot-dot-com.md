<p>It may be old news to some of you, but it's at last officially official. I'm a full-time <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/about/james-walker">lullabot</a>!</p>
<p>When I left Bryght at the beginning of the summer, I wasn't sure what the future would hold. But when <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/about/mattwestgate">Matt</a> approached me about potentially collaborating more on workshops and seminars (as we'd done <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/seminar/drupal_performance_and_scalability/sunnyvale_ca_2007">in Sunnyvale</a>), I had a great feeling about it. After spending the summer working with the 'bots and loving the <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/news/20070621/new_summer_workshops">summer workshop series</a>, I was pretty sure I'd found a new home.</p>
<p>My primary role at Lullabot will be to continue to grow and expand the workshop/training end of the business. We've been throwing around a bunch of really exciting ideas that you'll be hearing all about soon. Until then, <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/workshop/both-fall-workshops/providence-ri-2007">join us in Providence</a> for our last workshops of 2007!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lullabot.com/about/team">Team Lullabot</a> is amazing and I'm proud to be a part of it.</p>
