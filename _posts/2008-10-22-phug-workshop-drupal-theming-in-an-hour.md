<p>October is a busy speaking month - but I'm excited to say I've been asked back to present another (free) <a href="http://phug.ca/workshops/">PHUG Workshop</a> on Drupal.</p>

<p><a href="http://workshops.phug.ca/"><img src="http://walkah.net/sites/walkah.net/files/phugworks_news.png" alt="PHUG Workshops" /></a></p>

<p>Back in April, I did an <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/phug-free-drupal-workshop">Intro Workshop</a>. This time, I'll be showing off theming in Drupal 6:</p>

<blockquote>In this workshop, we will show the process of taking an HTML & CSS design and converting it into a fully working Drupal theme. Along the way, weâ€™ll look at the 3 main aspects of Drupal theming, some best practices and a few tricks. Drupal 6 makes the whole process easier than ever, so get started making your Drupal site look not like a Drupal site!</blockquote>

<p>The workshop is <strong>Tuesday Oct 28 2008 @ 630pm</strong> at Seneca @ York Campus in room 2112. See the <a href="http://phug.ca/workshops/index.php/freeworkshops">workshop announcement</a> for full details.</p>
