<p>Yesterday marked the end of the <a href="http://vancouver.php.net/">Vancouver PHP conference</a>, which was a lot of fun and went quite well (I thought). I led two sessions : one on <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> (with Johnny Bufu from <a href="http://www.sxip.com/">SXIP</a>). For those who don't know, I've been working a lot lately on getting OpenID support into Drupal - and it was nice to demo some of that work. I also covered how to use <a href="http://janrain.com/">JanRain's</a> <a href="http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/libraries/php">PHP Library</a> to OpenID-enable your PHP app (check out the <a href="http://walkah.net/files/vancouver-php-openid.pdf">slides here</a>).</p>
<p>I also led a session on beginning <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> module development. Those of you who attended the DrupalCon in Brussels may remember this as the infamous <a href="http://drupal.org/node/86528">pants talk</a> - always a crowd pleaser ;)</p>
<p>Thanks a lot to the organizers and sponsors from Vancouver PHP, I had a great time. Oh, and a special thank to Shane from <a href="http://activestate.com">ActiveState</a> - part of the speaker shwag package was a license to <a href="http://www.activestate.com/products/komodo_ide/">Komodo IDE</a>. I've heard good things about the latest Komodo, can't wait to check it out.</p>
