My last several weeks (months?) have been pretty darn hectic preparing for <a href="http://www.doitwithdrupal.com/">Do It With Drupal</a>. Well, we've done it with Drupal - and it was awesome! It was really fun bringing the whole <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/">Lullabot</a> team to make it happen. The speakers were awesome, the venue was great and the people rocked.

For those of you who missed it, the event was pretty well documented via <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23diwd">the twitter backchannel</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/diwd">flickr photos</a>. Thanks everyone!

I'm back home now... oh - and I moved! I'm now living in a beautiful house at St. Clair and Dufferin.

So it's time to settle in for the holiday season, finish getting unpacked and settled and enjoy a little breathing room. To kick it off, I'm heading to <a href="http://hohoto.ca/">#hohoto</a> tonight. Looking forward to partying with my local Toronto people!
