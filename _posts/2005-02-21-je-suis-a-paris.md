i'm on the wrong side of the ocean, gettin' ready for <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-conference-2005" title="drupal conference">drupalcon</a>. came over a couple days early to hang out with <a href="http://chad.walkah.net/">chad</a> (who is now a paris resident) before hoping a train to antwerp. jet lag is a funny thing, but according to the clock it's approaching dinner time (though, my stomach is rumbling for lunch). i have been here long enough to do a pretty nice walking tour (it's a balmy 1C here).... of course flickr's got the full story in pictures - follow my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkah/tags/paris/" title="paris photos on flickr">paris tag</a>.
