i *finally* commited to G2 for the second time this morning, this completing <a href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/task.php?func=detailtask&amp;project_task_id=86441&amp;group_id=7130&amp;group_project_id=14056">this</a> task - multple item deletion. it's a minor fix, but i'm still kind of getting used to the coding styles, etc. of the project and, thus, taking my time. i've been given 2 new tasks though, so hopefully things should pick up a bit more on this front.
