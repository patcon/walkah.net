<p>the long awaited <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/mobile/" title="Apple mobile itunes">itunes phone</a> was just unveiled - finally. <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1550" title="Boris Mann on the ROKR">boris</a> wonders if we'll be able to use them in Canada (just swap SIM cards? or will they be locked?). I'd hope they're not locked ... but you never know.</p>

<p>I've got to say, I actually don't care either way. I hate to say it - I'm not sure I'm that desperate for one. As many of you likely know, I'm not a huge phone guy - and while I do love gadgets, I'm not sure an iPod phone is really going to get my money. I'm much more interested these days in having things like wifi & bluetooth, etc. It doesn't help either that my previous motorola phone was <strong>awful</strong>.</p>

<p>of course, I can say this because a) I already have an iPod and b) nobody knows yet how easy it might be to use one in Canada. If I read that they're available on eBay and completely unlocked - I'll reconsider. Until then, I'll likely hold out for the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/n91">nokia n91</a>.</p>
