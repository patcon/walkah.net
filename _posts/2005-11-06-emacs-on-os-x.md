was just cruising through some feeds on a rainy sunday morning when I noticed <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/">tim bray's</a> post on <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/11/05/OS-X-Emacs">os x on emacs</a>. while probably not the most religious about my <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> usage, I have been using it as my primary editor for development for .. er.. well, as long as I can remember - including everywhere I use os x.

for a long time I was using what Tim refers to as the "Use the Source, Luke!" option... I must say I find --enable-carbon-app to be quite satisfactory. i should probably qualify that I'm not necessarily interested in emacs working like a "mac app". in fact, i use emacs everywhere because I want it to work like emacs.

my reason for posting, though, is to give a quick nod to the <a href="http://home.att.ne.jp/alpha/z123/emacs-mac-e.html">carbon emacs</a> package which I've been using on my macs for a few months now. it is bascically the source build, without the build time.. plus some included extensions for convenience. give it a shot.
