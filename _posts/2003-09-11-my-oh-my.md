where does the time go. jeez. since i last put anything here camryn has turned 1 and andrew is rapidly approaching his 6th (!!!!) birthday. not to mention the fact that i have a bunch of pictures that are still just sitting on the camera. problem with my big 256mb flash card is that i don't take enough pictures to need the room on the camera very often :P



oh well. i'll catch on to this whole blogging thing one day. not yet though apparently.
