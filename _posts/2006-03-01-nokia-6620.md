<p>last week, my old <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/new-phone">sony T616</a> kicked the bucket, which was all the excuse I needed to go for an upgrade. while I was hoping to get something really super fancy (like an <a href="http://www.nokia.com/n91">n91</a> or similar), it just wasn't in the budget. after some half-hearted poking around downtown, I ended up going for the lone <a href="http://www.s60.com/">series 60</a> phone currently offered by <a href="http://www.rogers.com/">rogers</a>: <a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/phones/6620">nokia 6620</a>.</p>

<p>even though it doesn't have a megapixel camera and I haven't quite figured out how to make coffee with it, i have to say I really like this phone. I understand now why all the <a href="http://www.bryght.com/">bryght guys</a> have nokia phones. series 60 is where it's at.</p>

<p>so far, i've got <a href="http://www.salling.com/Clicker/mac/">salling clicker</a> working - and it actually has a much nicer (more complete) UI - mostly due to the 6620's better and bigger screen.</p>

<p>I've also been playing with <a href="http://www.shozu.com/portal/">shozu</a> which makes me officially one of the cool kids. For those that don't know shozu, they're basically a super-duper <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a> (and others) uploading tool for camera phones. sadly, my phone's camera is a bit weak but it's still fun... check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkah/tags/shozu/">shozu pics</a>.</p>

<p>Next up (and secretly one of the reasons I was so into getting a series 60 phone): python hacking on my phone! (stay tuned)</p>
