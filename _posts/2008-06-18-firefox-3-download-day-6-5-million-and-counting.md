To generate some buzz around the new release, the folks at Mozilla are trying to set a <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/">Guinness World Record</a> for software downloads in 24 hours. They're initial target was 5 million downloads. As of this writing, they're at 6.5 million downloads and counting - with 6 hours to go!</p>
<p>I also spent a few hours last night at the <a href="http://mozillaparty.com/en-US/events/view/182">Mozilla Toronto launch party</a>. Mozilla is full of great people doing great work... it was nice to help celebrate their latest milestone.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet, go now. <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Get Firefox 3</a>.</p>
