<p>As usual, I'm several days late blogging things - but <a href="http://drupalcamptoronto.org/">Drupal Camp Toronto II</a> came and went last weekend. I'd say it went off without a hitch - but I'd be lying. I definitely have a new-found (or rediscovered?) admiration for event organizers... it ain't easy. On that note, I'd like to send out a *huge* thank you to those that made it happen, specifically: <a href="http://communitybandwidth.ca/">Phillip Smith</a>, <a href="http://openject.com/">Colan Schwartz</a>, <a href="http://www.brickswithoutclay.com/">Dan Kurtz</a> and <a href="http://alan.g.dixon.googlepages.com/">Alan Dixon</a>. Also, big thanks to <a href="http://www.substancecommunications.com/">Substance Communications</a> for coming through with great <a href="http://baheyeldin.com/technology/drupal/drupal-camp-toronto-07-wrap-up.html">tshirts</a> in record time - I'll be recommending them to everyone doing tshirts in Toronto!</p>
<p>I also wanted to mention that I've uploaded slides for 3 of my 4 presentations: <a href="http://drupalcamptoronto.org/node/6">Welcome and Drupal Overview</a>, <a href="http://drupalcamptoronto.org/node/138">OpenID</a> and <a href="http://drupalcamptoronto.org/node/135">Intro to Module Development</a>. I also did a semi-impromptu session, <a href="http://drupalcamptoronto.org/node/136">Building an event site in an hour</a> which outlined the building of <a href="http://drupalcamptoronto.org/">drupalcamptoronto.org</a> (which was based on the work from the <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org">oscms summit</a> site). I've had several inquiries about notes - list of modules, cck and views exports, etc. I'm actually working on a full, longer write-up on that... so stay tuned! :)</p>
<p>Thanks again, everyone! See you all next year (or at a <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/toronto">user group meeting</a> soon!).
