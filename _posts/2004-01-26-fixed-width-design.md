so after reading some <a href="http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/42/text_length.htm">fairly convincing articles</a> on <a href="http://www.phark.net/archives/000156.html">fixed width design</a>. i've decided to change this site to use a fixed width. it's supposed to improve readability. survey says?
