andrew's second weekend of hockey is done. he still really likes it... and a 7:30am practice just doesn't bother him. today was "Opti-day" at the <a href="http://www.auroratigers.com/">aurora tigers</a> game, so we went to that. (all players from andrew's league got in free if wearning their jersey). tigers won 17-3, which i must admit is the biggest blow-out i can remember seeing in a hockey game.
