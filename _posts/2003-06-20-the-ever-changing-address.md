<!--timestamp:1056125640:-->

so, i think i told everyone the saga i had with the town office about our house's address.  long story short... sometime back last november the town of aurora decided that our house should have a different address.  so they changed it. we're a corner lot, and they re-addressed based on the other street.



anyway, the big news is that after some nasty phone calls, a letter, and a lot of waiting our original address has been officially restored. yeah.



(p.s. the kids are all healthy again).
