<p>Hot on the heels of the <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-5.0">Drupal 5.0</a> release, we're pleased to announce that we're offering our <a href="http://www.bryght.com/news/2007/01/16/one-click-drupal-5-hosting-preview-release">Drupal 5 preview release</a> over at <a href="http://www.bryght.com/">Bryght</a>. Not only that, but we've also cut the price in half (now $20/month) - plus you still get a 30 day free trial. How's that for a sales pitch? ;)</p>
<p>"Off the record" (since this is my personal blog), I'm feeling re-energized about our shared hosting offering. We've completely <a href="http://www.bryght.com/news/2006/12/04/bryght-big-upgrade-new-servers-and-more">revamped our infrastructure</a> which, along with our partnership with <a href="http://firebright.com/">Firebright</a>, takes a lot off my plate in terms of the server management and will make scaling much easier moving forward. We've also got some good plans for keeping things "fresh" moving forward. But, the biggest benefit is that Drupal 5 is just a much nicer product than Drupal 4.5 was (which is when we started) - plus we've got <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">CCK</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a> - what more could you ask for? :)</p>
<p>So... go on, <a href="http://bryght.com/signup">sign up</a>. You know you want it.</p>
