<!--timestamp:1057514820:-->

so, i've been playing around with the site a little bit... playing some more with drupal, and re-arranging some other stuff.  most notably, i've seperated my "files" and "gallery" stuff. they're available via links in the right-hand column... but also you can go directly to: <a href="http://cvs.walkah.net/">http://cvs.walkah.net/</a> or <a href="http://gallery.walkah.net/">http://gallery.walkah.net/</a>.

(p.s. i also uploaded 2 - that's right 2! - new pictures from canada day)
