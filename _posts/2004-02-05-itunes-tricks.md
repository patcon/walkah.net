<p>decided to checkout 2 things today to make my iTunes experience more pleasurable:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mt-daapd.sourceforge.net/">mt-daapd</a> is a little daemon that implements the daapd protocol (used by iTunes sharing). what's so cool about this? it enables me to make my (rather extensive) audio library available automatically when my laptop is at home. i'd read <a href="http://www.whatsinyourbox.org/article28.html">an article</a> on how to do this before, but mt-daapd was much simpler, they've got <a href="http://www.debian.org/">debian</a> packages! :)</li>
<li>the other thing is a little utility called <a href="http://www.sprote.com/clutter/">clutter</a> it's a little app that shows your currently playing song (with some simple controls) in a small window. the other thing that's really cool about it, is it also displays the cover art for the song (fetched from amazon)</li>
</ul>
now, i can enjoy my music that much better while working at home. now to actually get some work done ;)
