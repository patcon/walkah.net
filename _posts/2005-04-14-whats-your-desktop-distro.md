i've recently gotten my grubby little hands on an x86 laptop (<a href="http://chad.walkah.net/" title="chad walker">my brother's</a> old laptop prior to his joining the cult of the mac) - a dell inspiron 2650. so - since i naturally have no intention of letting it retain it's current operating system ... i'm wondering which linux distribution proper geeks run on their laptops these days?
</p><p>
i'm currently thinking either <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/504Released" title="ubuntu linux">ubuntu hoary</a> (for that comfy old <a href="http://www.debian.org/">debian</a> feel) or <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">gentoo</a> (which i kinda <a href="http://walkah.net/node/88">liked before</a>).  anything way better?
