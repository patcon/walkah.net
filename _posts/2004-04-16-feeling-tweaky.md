so, as part of my little posting flurry, i spent some time actually looking at my site. frankly, i don't totally dig it. so, i've been playing around here and there trying to make it look cooler. how am i doing? :)

i did add some funky little status indicators for my IM accounts (over there ---&gt;). they actually work too. when they're grey i'm offline, otherwise i'm online. feel free to say 'hi'. the aim status trick i picked up from <a href="http://www.deanspace.org/">deanspace</a>. the jabber status is <a href="http://edgar.netflint.net/index.php">edgar the status bot</a>.
