so... it might be tax time, but tonight opened the nhl playoffs... and while my <a href="http://www.bostonbruins.com/" target="_blank">team</a> lost to new jersey in their first game... my adopted <a href="http://www.torontomapleleafs.com" target="_blank">team</a> won.



and there was much rejoicing.



TOR 1 - PHI 0

BOS 0 - NJ  1
