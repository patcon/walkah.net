<p>Happy Halloween everyone : <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-5.0-beta1">Drupal 5 beta1</a> has been released!</p>
<p>Amongst the several changes in Drupal 5, there is officially a <a href="http://drupal.org/node/91964">new default core theme</a>. After years and years of looking at bluemarine day after day, my eyes have been granted quite a treat. What's better: the new theme, "garland" comes with "color" module which allows you to easily customize the color scheme used.</p>
<p>To celebrate, I've switched this site to use garland - with the old walkah.net color scheme. Like it?</p>
