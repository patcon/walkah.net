noticed over at <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_07.html#005905">surfin' safari</a> this morning that the new (presumably for <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/">tiger</a>) version of webcore (the engine behind apple's safari web browser) will include support for contentEditable - which means that content management systems such as say <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">drupal</a> can offer <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/htmlarea">WYSIWYG HTML</a> editing inside the browser on safari. (functionality that already exists in firefox/mozilla and that other browser that some people use).  more good news for the next version of mac os x.  :)
