<p>so, in an effort to increase my blogging production, i thought i'd try using a blogging utility. thinking at first that i'd probably write one myself (as a chance to play with <a href="http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk/">pygtk</a>), i thought i'd <a href="http://www.google.com/">google</a> for an existing one just in case. well, of course, one already exists. so this is my first post with <a href="http://www.gnome.org/%7Eseth/gnome-blog/">gnome-blog</a>.</p><p>

seems nice so far anyway...</p>
