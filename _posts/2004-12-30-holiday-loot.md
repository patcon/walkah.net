it's been a good holiday. in addition to getting some much needed downtime and adding a few pounds around my midsection, i also got quite a few geek toys for christmas. prior to christmas, i made a point of updating my amazon wishlist for those of my non-technical family members (i.e. all of them) who find me difficult to buy for. it turned out to work quite well - although the funny part was none of my family members actually bought things from amazon - they checked out list and wandered off to local bricks and mortar type establishments.
</p><p>
nevertheless, it resulted in an overwhelming amount of toys... here's a quick recap:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000AAAPF/walkah-20"><img alt="griffin itrip" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0000AAAPF.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" class="left" /></a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000AAAPF/walkah-20">Griffin iTrip FM Audio Transmitter for 3G Apple iPods</a> - while, ideally i'd prefer to never drive... i do actually spend a fair bit of time in the car, because when i do drive it tends to be a trip to downtown toronto - which is a good 45 minutes away (at least!). this will be excellent to have since, well, most radio stinks.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00007KDVI/walkah-20"><img alt="linksys wrt54g" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00007KDVI.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" class="left" /></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00007KDVI/walkah-20"> "Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router"</a> - i've wanted one of these for a long time. my current wireless setup is only 80211.b - which means i miss out on a lot of speed for my powerbook. also, i've been dying to hack the linux</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002OZXG0/walkah-20"><img alt="apple isight" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0002OZXG0.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" class="left" /></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002OZXG0/walkah-20"> Apple iSight</a> - oh yeah. you know you want one too.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00064O1P0/walkah-20"><img alt="canon eos camera" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00064O1P0.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" class="left" /></a> as if that weren't enough... my darling wife heard my subtle hints for a new, smaller, faster digital camera. so, i am now (after some research and exchanging) the *very* proud owner of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00064O1P0/walkah-20">canon sd200</a>. first impressions - this is an awesome little camera, and exactly the kind of thing i was looking for - more later.
</li>
</ul>
