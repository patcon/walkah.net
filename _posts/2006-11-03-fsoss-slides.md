<p>A week ago today I was just wrapping up at seneca's <a href="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/fsoss/2006/">free software and open source symposium</a>. My talk, <a href="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/fsoss/2006/presentations/james-walker.htm">"Why Drupal can kick your CMS' ass"</a>, was a lot of fun and well received. Overall, I thought the event was really well done, and I look forward to taking part again next year!</p>
<p>For those who missed it and/or are interested: the slides from my talk are available <a href="http://walkah.net/files/drupal-fsoss-2006.pdf" title="FSOSS Drupal slides">here</a> and video is available <a href="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/fsoss/2006/recordings/">here</a>. Enjoy!</p>
