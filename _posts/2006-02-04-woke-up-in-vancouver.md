... only sort of sure how I got here. the last 4 or 6 weeks have been a bit personally chaotic - I'll leave it at that. all I know is I now find myself sitting at the illustrious <a href="http://www.take5cafe.com/">take5 cafe</a> (well, illustrious if you're <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/take5cafe">vancouver-based bryght guy</a>) with <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/" title="Boris Mann">boris</a> and <a href="http://bryght.com/about/the-team/adrian" title="Adrian Rossouw">adrian</a>.

I'm in town principally for <a href="http://oscms-summit.org/">the Open Source CMS summit</a> where I'm moderating a session on <a href="http://oscms-summit.org/events/file-api">drupal's file api</a>. Then, of course, I'm sticking around for the <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/">northern voice</a> conference and <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/moosecamp">moosecamp</a>.

we also happen to have a thing or two going on at <a href="http://bryght.com/">bryght</a>...

so, i'm here for just over a week. if you're amongst the people languishing in my inbox, my apologies. i'm digging myself back out of the hole that was January, you will likely hear from me soon.
