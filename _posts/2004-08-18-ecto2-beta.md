so, i woke up this morning to find an email from the amazing <a href="http://blog.kung-foo.tv">Adriaan</a> with instructions on how to download and install the <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/archives/001087.php">beta version of ecto2</a>. i've been looking forward to this since i first read the announcement that it was coming. so, naturally, i've spent the last couple minutes downloading and playing around with the beta. my first impression: i love it!

i don't really maintain a lot of blogs (hell, i don't even really update this one regularly), but ecto2 might encourage me to maintain more. the "paradigm shift" towards multiple post editing is really nice. rather than launching directly into a new post window, you're faced with a list of recent posts from your various blogs (of course, other than this one, my list consists of test accounts for various drupal installs :P). you can then easily begin a new post for any of your blogs (and work on a couple at the same time).

overall, i really dig it! oh and it works perfectly with drupal (which is what i'm supposed to be testing ;) )
