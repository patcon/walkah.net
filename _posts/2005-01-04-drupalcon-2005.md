the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/15126" title="Drupal Conference Announcement">"official" announcement</a> is out: the first ever "<a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-conference-2005" title="Drupal Conference '05">DrupalCon</a>" will happen in Brussels in late February. i will not only be attending (presuming I get myself a plane ticket), but I will also be presenting:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Multimedia in Drupal</strong> - James Walker, Drupal consultant and Bryght guy
<br />Images, audio and video clips are taking an increasingly prominent role on the internet - from personal photos to artist communities to "podcasts". We will begin by taking a look at the options for media handling that are currently available for Drupal, followed by a look into options for the future.
</blockquote><p>
the main presentations are taking place in the <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2005/index/dev_room_drupal">drupal developers room</a> at <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2005/">FOSDEM '05</a>. if you happen to be in brussels in late february, come by and check us out!
