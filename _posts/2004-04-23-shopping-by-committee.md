so, i hate <a href="http://www.shoprogers.com/store/wireless/content/phones/Phone_Details.asp?shopperID=4XXJU02CFPAL8H5J45DCFGAK3GK568B6&#38;name=Motorola%20V66&#38;number=25&#38;">my cell phone</a>. ok, "hate" is a strong word. but, i would like to at least be able to talk on my cell phone from my new basement office. i also completely dislike flip phones as it turns out. so, i want a new phone. but, i want a good one. sure, the p800/900's are nice and all, but not really my price range. so, i've casually been looking at alternatives. that's when i stumbled across the <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=ca&#38;lc=en&#38;ver=4000&#38;template=pp1_loader&#38;php=php1_10076&#38;zone=pp&#38;lm=pp1&#38;pid=10076">sony ericsson t616</a>. i like that it has bluetooth (have i mentioned i _really_ want a bluetooth gadget to play with my powerbook?), is iSync compatible, is *not* a flip phone, and even has a camera (so i could <a href="http://www.moblog.com/">moblog</a> 'n' stuff). The best part, though, is that it's a fraction of the cost of a p800. but, what i'd really like to know is... anyone out there used or know of anyone who uses this phone? got a similar one you would recommend instead? care to donate a cool gadget? ;)

please leave word :)
