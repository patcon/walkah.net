<p>It's mid-October which means it's nearly time for one of Toronto's best run tech conferences again: Seneca's <a href="http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2007/">Free Software and Open Source Symposium</a> happens next week, October 25-26. I had the pleasure of being asked to speak last year, and even managed to get asked back this year. Naturally, I'll be talking about <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>... twice:</p>
<p><a href="http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2007/presentationDetails.php?presentationID=90">Drupal Hands-on</a> will be a workshop-style crash course in building sites with Drupal. I really dig doing these things, it's amazing how much you can do with Drupal in a few hours.</p>
<p><a href="http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2007/presentationDetails.php?presentationID=39">Drupal under the hood</a> is my "formal" presentation. Essentially, I'm going to give a brief hour-long overview of Drupal's internal architecture and hopefully inspire some hackers in the audience to dive in.</p>
<p>Some might say that alone is <a href="http://opensourcecommunity.org/2007/10/11/2007-free-software-and-open-source-symposium">reason enough to attend</a>, but if you're not convinced check out the rest of the <a href="http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2007/speakers.php">awesome speakers</a>. I can't say it enough, I think this is a really well done event and there's still room so <a href="http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2007/register.php">register now!</a>.</p>
