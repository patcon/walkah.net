so, it's been a long time, and lots has happened but the big news this week is that andrew has the chicken pox.  poor kid.  the worst part is that he's got a bunch of stuff going on these days. he's missing a field trip today, he'll probably miss soccer next week, and then his uncle chad is coming to visit and his graduation is next thursday.

poor guy.
