<!--timestamp:1063654080:-->

<p>so i finally got <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~seth/gnome-blog/">gnome-blog</a> working from CVS. i had some troubles at first because my box (running <a href="http://www.debian.org/">debian</a>) was trying to use an older version of automake. however, i fixed this and now have things working properly.</p><p>

my next task is to tweak gnome-blog so that it works-for-me. one feature i'd like to see is editing of previous posts. but my first hack is to add title tags to the bloggerAPI module (since <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">drupal</a> groks those).</p><p>

consider this post a test.</p>
