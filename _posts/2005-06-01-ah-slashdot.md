<p>
someone *please* explain to me why "<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/01/2043242">Longhorn Drops 'My' Prefixes</a>" is frontpage news...
</p><p>
i mean, it's one thing that <a href="http://slashdot.org/">slashdot</a> doesn't do full-post RSS feeds or that they strip out all links (trying to eek every last advertising dollar). but, lately every post on slashdot worth reading is already in my <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire">aggregator-of-the-week</a> (as a full post, usually). and now.... now i come home to this? what, am i to expect intriguing discussion in the comments?

sorry slashdot, it's been a fun ride...
