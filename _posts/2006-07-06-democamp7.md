<p>well, after missing 2 official <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampTdot">BarCampToronto</a> events as well as the first 6 <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCamp">DemoCamps</a>, I finally made it to <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampToronto7">DemoCamp7</a> last night. </p>

<p>I definitely have to make it to more of these - lots of fun, interesting folks 'round here. My highlights were: <a href="http://damian.conway.org/About_us//Bio_formal.html">Damian Conway</a> talking about Perl 6 - he's a really entertaining speaker, <a href="http://paruba.com/">paruba.com</a> - for looking like something i might actually use, and seeing <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/">David Crow</a> out and about - without him toronto wouldn't even have a tech entrepreneur scene at all.</p>

<p>fingers crossed i can make it to the next one too...</p>
