<p>At the end of this month, I will be taking part in the <a href="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/fsoss/2006/">free software & open source symposium</a> at <a href="http://yorku.ca/">York university</a>. I'll be leading a <a href="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/fsoss/2006/workshop.html#drupal" title="Building a Great Drupal Site Without Touching a Line of Code">workshop</a> on Thursday, Oct 26th and am giving a <a href="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/fsoss/2006/presentations/james-walker.htm" title="Why Drupal Can Kick Your CMS' Ass">presentation</a> on Friday, Oct. 27th.</p>

<p>I'm there primarily to discuss <a href="http://drupal.org/">drupal</a> (of course), but am looking forward to hanging out with other free software developers and enthusiasts. The <a href="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/fsoss/2006/speakers.html">confirmed speaker list</a> is fairly impressive, several folks there I've followed with interest for a while. Hope to see you there!</p>
