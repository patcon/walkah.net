<p>i didn't say anything about it yesterday, but dries managed to get <a href="http://drupal.org/node/view/6853">drupal 4.4</a> out the door. while chances are if you care, you didn't hear it here first, but it's pretty cool because 2 of "major changes" are my fault. specifically:
<ul>
<li>Added support for the MetaWeblog API and MovableType extensions.</li>
<li>Refactored 404 (file not found) handling to support custom 404 pages.</li>
</ul>
with any luck, by the time 4.5 (or maybe version 5?) gets out the door, I'll have contributed a lot more. but, hey... it's a start.</p>
