the longer I go using my powerbook as my primary (only) desktop machine, the deeper certain things become ingrained in my daily routines. one big example is <a href="http://growl.info/" title="growl homepage">growl</a>. so, in honour of the latest release (0.7) i thought i'd publicly exclaim just how much i like having growl.
</p><p>
for those that haven't tasted this particular kool-aid: growl provides a framework so that applications (on Mac OS X) can create little popups when "things happen". so, some examples are : when the song changes in <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" title="Apple iTunes">iTunes</a>, new mail arrives, or someone says something in <a href="http://www.apple.com/ichat/">iChat</a> or <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a>.
</p><p>
the interesting thing is that human brains are *really* good at recognizing patterns, and determining (almost instantly) relative importance. so, without really looking up from the code, email or blog entry i'm currently writing, i can stay on top of other things going on - without having to switch applications, etc.
</p><p>
for example: i'm currently writing a blog post, and without changing apps (or even pausing) i can see that iTunes just changed - to "About A Girl" by Nirvana, and that <a href="http://daemon.co.za/">Adrian</a> wants to get a <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/psp.aspx" title="Sony Playstation Portable">sony psp</a>, eventually.
</p><p>
some people might find it distracting, but it's amazing how quickly your mind and eyes become trained to find the important things. that's where growl's ability to re-style messages on a per-application basis comes in handy. i use the "music video" style for iTunes changes (which shows track information along the bottom) vs. new mail notification using the "bezel" style. so - without even reading anything, i know based on where a notification appeared whether it's low importance (song change) or worth glancing at (new mail).
</p><p>
just one of those things that makes me more productive... i suppose at some point i should do a more complete post on my "essential" apps... another time.
