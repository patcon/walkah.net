<p>A typical weekend at my house tends to involve a fair bit of lego building. For some reason (largely because neither Camryn nor Andrew was feeling well), we decided to spend most of Sunday working on our largest lego project yet: a <a href="http://shop.lego.com/Product/?p=10174">star wars at-st</a>.</p>
<p>So, last night, I posted a bunch of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/walkah/tags/lego/">pictures to flickr</a> completely unaware that today <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2008/01/lego-celebrates.html">Lego turns 50</a>. How timely! My friends over at NowPublic.com even picked one of my pictures for <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/money/lego-still-going-strong-after-50-years">a  story</a> about it. :)</p>
<p>Happy Birthday, Lego. Thanks for keeping two generations busy in this house.</p>
