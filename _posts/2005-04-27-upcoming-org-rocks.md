finally spent a little time another one of those "gotta have" social-y sites to emerge over the past : <a href="http://www.upcoming.org/" title="upcoming events">upcoming.org</a> . i gotta say, i love it. it's got all the "must have" parts for today's sites : a <a href="http://upcoming.org/services/api/" title="upcoming api">RESTful API</a>, event <a href="http://upcoming.org/tag/" title="upcoming tags">tagging</a> and of course <a href="http://upcoming.org/friend/" title="Upcoming friends">buddy lists</a> (man, those <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/" title="FOAF project">FOAF</a> guys might be on to something). I also dig that they've got iCal feeds too.

For those of you just in it to stalk me ... my page is <a href="http://upcoming.org/user/13655/" title="James Walker on upcoming">here</a> . Oh, and because I can't get through a post without it, there is (of course) already a <a href="http://hybernaut.com/upcoming-module">drupal module</a> in the works. I'll be checking that out for sure (but, of course if I enable it here - everyone will know how infrequently I leave the house).

oh, and... i just *had* to add the <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/18322/" title="Mike Doughty at the Rivoli">mike doughty show</a>. ;)
