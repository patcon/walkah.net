<p>I realize it's pretty late notice, but looks like the first ever meetup of the Toronto Drupal Users Group is a go for tonight.</p>

<p>If you happen to be in toronto, love drupal, and are free tonight - come on by the <a href="http://linuxcaffe.com/location">linuxcaffe</a> : 6pm - 8pm.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there, and if not - at a future meet up. Oh, and I'll report back here (hopefully) tomorrow.</p>
