so, i realize it's a couple days late... but on sunday chad and i took in the <a href="http://www.rush.com/">rush's 30th anniversary tour</a> show at the molson amphitheatre. two words: it rocked. watching neil peart live always makes me regret that my drums are in storage. anyway, we had so damned much fun, we bought t-shirts. it's been over 10 years since i bought a concert t-shirt, it was that good. not bad for a bunch of old dudes.

if you like rush, and their coming to your town - check it out.
