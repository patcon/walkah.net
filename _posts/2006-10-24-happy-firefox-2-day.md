<p>truth be known, I've been using firefox 2 for a while (off and on through betas and exclusively since RC1) but i thought i'd wait to post about it so  that i didn't overload the mozilla.org servers with my referral traffic. ;)</p>
<p>version 2 is a pretty solid (although arguably subtle) upgrade. performance feels much snappier and the UI update is nice... but my favourite improvements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tab updates: close buttons on each tab, and the new tab scrolling feature is very handy for those of us with typically 30+ tabs open.</li>
<li>built in "session saver": firefox restarts to your last set of tabs - great for those rare crashes.</li>
<li>inline spellchecking : makes me look smrt ;)</li>
<li>configurable feed subscription handling: since i prefer using external feed readers</li>
</ul>
<p>looking at that list, i realize what firefox 2 really means is I don't need nearly as many extensions as I used to to get my firefox the way i like it. <a href="http://getfirefox.com/" title="firefox 2">go get it</a> (or check the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0/releasenotes/" title="firefox 2 release notes">full list of changes</a>).</p>
