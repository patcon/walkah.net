<p>so, last night (almost by fluke) i "officially" joined the <a href="http://gallery.sf.net/">gallery</a> development team. gallery is software i use to manage <a href="http://gallery.walkah.net/">my pictures</a>. it's pretty cool, and they're (or should i say "we're") now working on  the next version. to start i've offered to help however i can. but i may take on an installer and i'd also love to see gallery get an <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">xmlrpc</a> interface.</p><p>

i'll keep you posted as i go.</p>
