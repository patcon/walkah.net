Well, this post - much like the first five days of 2009 - has <a href="http://twitter.com/walkah/status/1093056373">not</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/walkah/status/1096088163">gone</a> as I'd <a href="http://twitter.com/walkah/status/1098018094">planned</a>.

Looking back on 2008, it was another year of intense growth and change - as they all seem to be lately. I moved again, did a <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/walkah/public">lot of travelling</a> and had a pretty big year as a <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/">Lullabot</a> (1 <a href="http://www.doitwithdrupal.com/">major event</a>, 1 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Using-Drupal-Angela-Byron/dp/0596515804/">book</a>, 1 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Drupal-Jeff-Robbins/dp/B001GXCVWK/">DVD</a>, 7 workshops, and countless hours of getting people over their Drupal hurdles).

2009 holds lots of opportunity, potential and continued opportunities for growth and change. As far as resolutions, however, I have just one:

**get healthy**

That's right, the usual sleep more, eat better, exercise (period), go to the doctor, see a dentist, take time off, look out for me kind of just get healthy.

Ready? begin.
