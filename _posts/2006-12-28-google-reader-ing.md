<p>OK <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a>, you got me. I'll admit, I *almost* switched when <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/switching-to-google-reader">Boris</a> did. I tried it at the time... sorta liked it... but <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/switching-to-google-reader#comment-134976">had my concerns</a>. But this week, I've re-thought my position, given it another try, and I think it might stick. What changed? Well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/releases/2.0b1.html">Thunderbird 2.0b1</a> was released (more on that later). What does that have to do with it? Well, one complaint was that reader doesn't support authenticated feeds - which I use a *lot* of for work. Incidentally those are the same feeds I'm most interested in having access to when offline. I actually find Thunderbird's feed handling decent - and the nice part of having work feeds in my mail app is that I follow a similar workflow there as I do with my mail (including <a href="http://www.growl.info/">growl</a> alerts for new posts), and there's a clear separation between stuff I <em>need</em> to pay attention to vs. the rest (although, most of the feeds I follow are work related - the ones I'm talking about here are bug reports and internal tickets, etc).</li>
<li>Getting the <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/nokia-n91">n91</a>. Simple: a phone with wifi is amazingly useful. I can do a quick feed catchup anywhere with wifi without having to drag out my laptop. OK, maybe this mobile craze has legs.</a>
<li>Discovering the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3977/">Google Reader Notifier</a> extension for firefox. It helps me keep an eye on what's been posted without having an extra (or even an extra tab) open.</li>
</ul>
<p>It took a little fiddling with the workflow, a bit of adjustment,  and some time memorizing the <a href="http://www.google.com/help/reader/faq.html#shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a>, but I'm finally pretty happy with things. And, I no longer have to worry about syncing issues.</p>
<p>I've been a long time user of both <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> and <a href="http://kula.jp/software/endo/">endo</a> - and I love both for different reasons. But, man, google is actually making web apps I don't hate. *gasp*</p>
