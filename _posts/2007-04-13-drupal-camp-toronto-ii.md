<p>The second annual DrupalCampToronto is all set to go next month! I'm looking forward to this event - as it should be a good chance to see lots of great Drupal folks without having to hop on a plane. I've also been trying to help grow the local community in Toronto and this should be an awesome event for that. We're booked for 2 days - May 11th and 12th (Friday and Saturday) in 4 rooms at the <a href="http://www.greatspaces.utoronto.ca/projects/bahen.htm">Bahen Centre</a> at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>Full details, registration and session proposals are all being handled at http://drupalcamptoronto.org/ . Hope to see ya there!</p>
