<p>ahoy! in case you're not part of the perverse corner of the internet that knows... today is <a href="http://talklikeapirate.com/piratehome.html">talk like a pirate day</a>. to honour the occasion - the posts in this blog have been re-written in "pirate speak".</p>

<p>of course, i didn't actually re-write anything. the magic, of course, is all done by drupal, and fellow <a href="http://www.bryght.com/">bryght guy</a>, <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/">richard eriksson's</a> lovely <a href="http://drupal.org/node/31270">pirate.module</a> for drupal.</p>

<p>yes, it's silly. and yes it will be gone tomorrow :)</p>
