i wasn't online much over the holidays... but now that we're beyond all that, i'm back at my desk momentarily (still in my pj's at 3pm).  the whole christmas marathon has come and gone and was by all accounts a roaring success. as for me personally, i received probably the top 2 things on my personal wishlist: new hiking boots (from sandi) and an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> from pat.
i must say, i'm a pretty happy camper... now back to dumping tunes onto the iPod :)
