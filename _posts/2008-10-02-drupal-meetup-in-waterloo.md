As <a href="http://baheyeldin.com/technology/drupal/waterloo-region-drupal-users-group-friday-october-3-james-walker-module-development.html">Khalid announced</a>, I'll be heading out to Waterloo, ON tomorrow evening to give an introduction to module development with Drupal. Khalid has asked me to brush one of my old favourites: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/86528">Pants module</a>. It's a nice, fun way to get your feet wet with module development.

It will be my first visit out to the (relatively) new <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/waterloo-region">Waterloo Drupal Group</a>. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone and hopefully meeting some new faces!

For full details on the event, see <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/14621">this post</a> and sign up!

For those of you here in Toronto who can't make the trip, I hope to see you at next week's <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/15513">Toronto meeting</a>.
