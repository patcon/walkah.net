so, it looks like (according to <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2079307">this article</a>) one of my favourite <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#38;uid=UIDMISS70401301705360378&#38;sql=B2fkvu3ehan4k">hip-hop artists turned actor</a> has been cast to play the role of ford in the upcoming disney remake of hitchhiker's guide.
perhaps i'll see it then. actually, i'd probably see it anyway... just so i could say how badly disney butchered it.
