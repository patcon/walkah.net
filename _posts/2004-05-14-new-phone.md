well, i took the plunge. thanks for <a href="http://walkah.net/node/view/65#comment">the feedback</a> guys. i got a t616. all i can say is : "cool". i'm by no means a veteran in the whole cell phone scene. i haven't had all the cool phones. but, i like this one a lot (granted, my old phone sucked which has lowered my expectations). i love that my connections seem to be clearer, it's _not_ a flip phone, and most of all.... bluetooth!  my first iSync over bluetooth was a wonderful experience - worth the price of admission.

perhaps tomorrow i'll play with the built-in camera a bit :)
