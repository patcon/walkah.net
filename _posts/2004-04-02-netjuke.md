<p>so, it would appear that they beat me to <a href="http://www.netjuke.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=31&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0">the announcement</a>, but yes, i've "officially" joined another open source software project.  <a href="http://www.netjuke.org/">netjuke</a> is a really cool piece of software - web based audio management tool. but what's cooler is some of the things that are in store for the major rewrite that will be netjuke2. i've spent some time chatting lately with <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/sbw/blog">blake</a> and he's got some great ideas.</p>

<p>so, watch this space for more news about that.</p>
