<p>i went to a meeting monday night for a group known as <a href="http://whatistheclearing.com/">the clearing</a>. can't say i know exactly what the clearing is or will be yet - check the <a href="http://whatistheclearing.com/wiki/index.php/Mission_Statement">mission statement</a> - but it was only the 3rd meeting and my first.</p>

<p>however, last night was a fairly interesting discussion / debate about intellectual property and copyright - lots of heavy <a href="http://lessig.org/">lessig</a> quoting. as with most meetups (in my opinion) it was more about who than what or why. to that end, i enjoyed getting a chance to meet <a href="http://suthakamal.blogspot.com/">sutha kamal</a> and james reid (whom i've known online for years as "batz") in addition to seeing some <a href="http://jesse.openflows.org/index.php">familiar faces</a>.</p>

<p>hope i'm able to make more of these and maybe answer "what is the clearing"...</p>
