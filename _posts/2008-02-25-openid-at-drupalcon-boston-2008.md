<p><img src="http://walkah.net/sites/walkah.net/files/drupalconboston.jpg" alt="DrupalCon Boston 2008" class="left" />Here we go again! One week from today, <a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/">DrupalCon Boston 2008</a> will get underway. For the 3rd straight conference, I'll be doing a    session on <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> in Drupal:</p>
<p><a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/openid-and-identity-drupal-future-usermodule">OpenID and Identity in Drupal: the future of user.module</a></p>
<p>Those of you who have attended my OpenID talks at previous DrupalCons should definitely come out to this one, as I would like to dive a bit deeper into roadmapping future changes, additions and directions for the code as well as touching on rolling out OpenID support across the Drupal.org infrastructure itself. I'd also like to discuss additions and changes to user.module that will better accommodate alternate authentication mechanisms.</p>
<p>Can't wait to see you there! Oh, and yes, I'll bring <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7591336@N07/1414181703/">my socks</a> ;-)</p>
