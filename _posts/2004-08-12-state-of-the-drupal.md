so, while i was away a *lot* happened with everyone's favourite <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">content management system</a>. it looks like version 4.5 is going to really be awesome! some of the really cool stuff that happened while i was away:

<ul>
<li>node access : allows modules to restrict access to individual nodes</li>
<li>new locale.module : allows import/export of gettext .po files to greatly simplify translation (hear that <a href="http://www.terminus1525.ca/">terminus</a> folks?)</li>
<li>plus, some work towards allowing multiple sites to run off a single drupal code base</li>
</ul>
read more about what's coming in 4.5 <a href="http://drupal.org/node/view/9652">here</a>.

plus, drupal.org just got it's <a href="http://drupal.org/node/view/10000">10,000th node</a>!!

i've got some things i'd like to sneak into 4.5 as well, so i'll get back to working on those now :)
