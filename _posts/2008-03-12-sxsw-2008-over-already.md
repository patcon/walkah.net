<p><a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/"><img src="http://walkah.net/sites/walkah.net/files/sxsw2008.png" alt="SXSW Interactive" class="left" /></a>A few of us <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/">Lullabots</a> flew directly from <a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/">DrupalCon Boston</a> to Austin for <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/">SXSW Interactive</a>. It was actually my first trip down to Austin (sadly), and despite some general road weariness, I had a rockin' good time. Personal highlights included:</p>
<p><a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP060532">Worst. Website. Ever.</a>: Aside from being a who's who of the internet famous, it was an awesome format, completely hilarious and really well presented. I'm inspired to bring it to a future DrupalCon :-)</p>
<p><a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP060295">A Critical Look At OpenID</a>: It was nice to watch other OpenID experts field the same questions I tend to - and give similar answers. Mostly, I hit this panel because I hadn't yet met <a href="http://www.davidrecordon.com/">David</a> or <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">Simon</a>. We had <a href="http://termie.jaiku.com/presence/28539534">lunch</a> together after... I should really get myself out to more identity events. <a href="http://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php/Iiw2008a">IIW 2008</a>?</p>
<p><a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP060364">CMS Roundup</a>: Obviously, I went to support fellow 'bot, <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/about/jeffeaton">Jeff Eaton</a>, but was blown away by the packed audience (for a 10am session) and the overwhelming <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> love!</p>
<p>Otherwise, it was great to hang out with friends like <a href="http://www.mixedcontent.com/">Colin</a> and <a href="http://term.ie/blog/">Andy</a>, seeing <a href="http://barcamp.org/TorCamp">TorCamp</a> friends everywhere, and meeting a whackload of new people. Looking forward to next year already!</p>
