<p>I was just in the midst of a Sunday morning podcast & RSS catchup stint, when I caught <a href="http://commandn.typepad.com/commandn/2008/05/commandn-131-ma.html">Episode #131 of commandN</a> where <a href="http://www.jeffmacarthur.blogspot.com/">Jeff</a> was outlining some Front Row tips and tricks. It reminded me that I came across a great one recently that I thought I'd share.</p>
<p>As Jeff mentioned, <a href="http://perian.org/">Perian</a> is a great (indispensible) tool to allow QuickTime to play non-QT file formats (particularly AVI/DivX). And, while it's true that Front Row will then play any AVI files in your Movies folder, I've long wanted to go one step further - specifically for TV Shows. See, iTunes will keep TV Shows separately and mark ones that are "unwatched", etc.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://dettmer.maclab.org/movie2itunes.html">Movie2iTunes</a>. This droplet allows you to simply drop Movie & TV Shows on it and it will add them to iTunes. In fact, if your TV Show files use the given file naming convention, the TV Show metadata (show name, season, episode) will be completed correctly as well. The script works by creating a QuickTime media link to the original video - which has the nice benefit of having all your movies and TV shows in iTunes (hence front row) but they can still reside on, say, an external HD. I love it!</p>
