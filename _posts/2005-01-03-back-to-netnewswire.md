a while ago, i stopped using <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">netnewswire</a> for feed reading and started exclusively using <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/" title="Bloglines web-based feed reading">bloglines</a> - since bloglines is a web-based service it's available anywhere i've got a browser, and my read news stays in sync. well, <a href="http://www.inessential.com/2004/12/31.php" title="Brent Simmons, NetNewsWire author">brent</a> gave me a reason to switch back to netnewswire...

From <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire2.0b10.php">NetNewsWire 2.0b10 Change Notes</a>:
</p><blockquote>
The main new feature of this beta is support for RSS enclosures&#8212;aka &#8220;podcasting.&#8221; There are several smaller new features: Yahoo News search feeds, a downloads window, support for Atom linkblogs, smart list enhancements, better feedback at startup, and more.
</blockquote><p>
now the <em>killer</em>  feature will be when he finally implements the <a href="http://bloglines.com/services/api/sync" title="bloglines sync api">bloglines sync api</a> so i can stay in sync with bloglines.
