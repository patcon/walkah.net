just getting around to it now... but last friday (the 14th) i became an uncle again. spent saturday in cambridge to meet my new baby nephew noah. he was born may 14 at 2:36pm - 8lbs 3oz. he's a cutie, but i'll let you judge for yourself -  <a href="http://gallery.walkah.net/noah">check out the pics</a>.

camryn absolutely loves the idea of having a baby in the family. she was beside herself with excitement when she got to see him. she was still talking about him most of the day yesterday. she's starting to string words together, and sums it up with "baby no-yah mall" (baby noah small) - complete with adorable little hand gestures. :)
