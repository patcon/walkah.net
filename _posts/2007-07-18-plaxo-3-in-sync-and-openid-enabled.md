<p>As I've <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/keeping-myself-sync">lamented here</a> before, I have had a hard time finding a successful, efficient way to keep all of my personal data (largely calendar and contact data) in sync across my systems and devices. Well, I had registered for a service known as <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/">Plaxo</a> a while back to check it out. I can't exactly remember why it didn't stick at the time, but when I first saw <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/06/24/plaxo-brings-out-new-contact-manager-but/">Scoble</a> talking about a "Big 3.0 release", I thought I'd give it another shot. Here's the good news...</p>
<p>Plaxo is currently successfully keeping my Mac OS X address book (for subsequent syncing to my phone), iCal, Thunderbird and Google Calendar in sync! I have to say, the Thunderbird support is pretty huge... Thunderbird LDAP support has never been what I would like, so this is a great intermediary.</p>
<p>However, the news that pushed me to blog about my Plaxo usage is this: (as of it looks like yesterday) <a href="http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2007/07/plaxo_is_now_op.html">Plaxo is OpenID enabled</a>!! Awesome! Nice addition to <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> and <a href="http://www.blinksale.com/home">Blinksale</a> in services that I actually use heavily that are OpenID enabled.</p>
<p>Thumbs up for Plaxo. Now... if I could just figure out how to get it to sync my address book pictures...</p>
