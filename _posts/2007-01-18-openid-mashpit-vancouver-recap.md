Despite demoing some code still under very active development, and having our internet connection drop in the middle of it - it was nice to show off some of the stuff I've been working on lately in a crowd that "gets it". More interesting, however, was getting a chance to talk about and get some clarification on certain aspects. In particular, I feel like I have a much better idea of the vision behind <a href="http://openid.net/specs.bml">Attribute Exchange</a> and how it should ideally work. If nothing else, getting to just chat about "Identity 2.0" with <a href="http://blame.ca/dick/">Dick</a> was a treat.</p>
<p>Other bits of interest: we stood up a work-in-progress OpenID Provider (OP) for <a href="http://www.bryght.com/">Bryght</a> at <a href="http://home.bryght.com/">home.bryght.com</a> (using all native <a href="http://drupal.org/project/openid">drupal code</a>). It's *very* much still a work in progress, but also one of the earliest OP's "in the wild" to support the 2.0 draft spec (or most of it anyway). Similarly, SXIP has a <a href="https://verify.sxip.com/demorp/">demo Relying Party</a> (RP) that supports attribute exchange - that will come in handy for testing against.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the folks at <a href="http://www.sxip.com/">SXIP</a> for hosting a great event, and thanks to everyone who showed up!</p>
