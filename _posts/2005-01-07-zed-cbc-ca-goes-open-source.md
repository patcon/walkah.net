wow. kudos to the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/" title="Canadian Broadcast Corporation">CBC</a> for their honourable move in releasing the source code for <a href="http://zed.cbc.ca/opensource">zed.cbc.ca</a>:
</p><blockquote>

</blockquote><p>
we were very aware of zed during the development of <a href="http://www.terminus1525.ca/" title="terminus 1525 ">terminus1525.ca</a>... we were even picked for a <a href="http://zed.cbc.ca/go.ZeD?CONTENT_ID=43409&#38;page=content" title="terminus1525 zed site of the week">zed site of the week</a>. can't wait to check it out :)
