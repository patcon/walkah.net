<p>Yay! I got tagged for what I believe is the first time in a real live official cool kid blogging meme! So, <a href="http://www.sarahpullman.com/blog/sarahfelicity/shucks-im-it">Sarah</a> wants the world to know 5 new things about me. Let's see if I can come up with something nobody knows...</p>
<ol>
<li>My last name is "Walker" <strong>not</strong> "walkah". I know. But, <a href="http://lists.drupal.org/archives/documentation/2004-12/msg00037.html">people</a> get it <a href="http://www.cortextcommunications.com/node/141">wrong</a> a <a href="http://2tbsp.com/blog/?p=4">lot</a>.</li>
<li>I am <a href="http://www.43people.com/tag/not+canadian">not Canadian</a>. Sure, lots of people know that one. My family mostly has it figured out, and of course there's everyone who's seen my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/unconed/191570491/">passport on flickr</a>. But I do live in Canada (have for 12 years now) and I say "eh" a lot, so people get confused.</li>
<li>I play hockey. OK, lots of people knew that, but at one point I was quite serious about my hockey career. Lesser known fact here is that I played for a semester at <a href="http://www.union.edu/">Union College</a> (NCAA Division I). Oh, and I'm a goalie.</li>
<li>I want to quit the internet and be a rockstar. Heard that one before? Well, despite what the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sarahfelicity/260023634/">pictures</a> on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/31326261/">flickr</a> suggest, I don't consider myself a guitar player (or much of a singer) - although I love it. Truth is, my real passion is my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkah/12140396/">drums</a>.</li>
<li>I still have my teddy bear from when I was a baby. He's small and worn and his name is "bear". *Very* few of you probably knew that one. ;)</li>
</ol>
<p>There you have it. Now I'm supposed to tag a new group.... hmmm. Well, I think <a href="http://chad.walkah.net/">Chad</a> could probably come up with some interesting stuff. I'm sure the internet would love to read more about <a href="http://buytaert.net">Dries</a> and the enigma that is <a href="http://term.ie/blog">termie</a>. Not sure I have enough real "blogger" friends to really keep the chain going strong. Perhaps that's a good thing...</p>
