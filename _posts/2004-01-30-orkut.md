so, i finally took the plunge into the online social network phenomenon by getting invited to join <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">orkut</a> . honestly, i haven't paid much attention to this 'craze' ... but orkut is invite only, so now i feel important ;)
first impressions are - it's kind of addictive, though i'm not sure i get the real point and/or value... that said i've spent the last hour or more playing around with it :P
feel free to let me know (via comment here, or email, etc) if you're dying to be one of the elite :)
