<p>Happy New Year, everyone! I'd thought I'd do one of those popular 2007 recap / 2008 resolution posts... largely for my own future interest.</p>
<p>2007 was a big year for me (again). I <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/not-so-bryght-anymore">left Bryght</a> (the company I co-founded in 2004) and a few months later happily <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/james-lullabot-dot-com">joined Lullabot</a> (my absolute favourite job to date). My divorce finalized and <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/buh-bye-039burbs">I moved</a>. I sold a car and a house. I spent a lot of time working on <a href="http://walkah.net/tag/openid">OpenID</a> (particularly getting it into <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/drupal-6-and-openid">core for Drupal 6</a>). I traveled to Vancouver, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Providence and Boston. Camryn turned 5, Andrew turned 10, and I <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/thirty">turned 30</a>. *Phew*</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to 2008. I have very high hopes. Work is busy, exciting and looks like it should be a very successful year. I'm happy, healthy and loving life. I want to drink more water, sleep more, see more of the world and meet more people. With day #1 of the year just finished, I'm off to a good start and ready for more.</p>
<p>Bring it on, 2008. I'm ready :)</p>
