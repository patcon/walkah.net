timing is everything. yes, i'm not the first to report it, but yes <a href="http://secure.sixapart.com/">six apart</a> is playing around with their licensing for <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">movable type</a>. while they've never really been about 'free software' it's clear that this move has and will <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/its_about_time.shtml#trackback">alienate some people</a>.

now, i don't use movabletype myself for anything, but i am interested in <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">drupal</a> as a blogging tool (thus my work on <a href="http://walkah.net/node/view/25">blogapi.module</a>, etc). and, while it is soooo much more than just a blogging tool, drupal may be a good choice for those of you looking for an free, open source alternative (you <a href="http://james.seng.cc/archives/2004_05.html">would not</a> <a href="http://www.jluster.org/node/view/63">be alone</a>).

*ahem* <a href="http://walkah.net/node/view/66">here we come </a>*ahem* ;)
