<p>I blogged a while back about <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/komodo-4-0-im-trying">trying out komodo 4.0</a>, the development IDE from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a>. In the end, to be honest, I just couldn't really get into it. One of my biggest reasons for not sticking with it was performance: it's tough to learn a new app if it's routinely slow and unresponsive. However, <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/komodo-4-0-im-trying#comment-30892">JeffG pointed out</a> in a comment that Komodo worked much better on Intel Macs than PPC. So, I thought I'd give it a whirl on the new macbook pro.</p>
<p>The difference in performance is <em>amazing</em>. I can actually use this tool now as it was meant to be used! With apologies to <a href="http://sachachua.com/">Sacha</a> and all the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs people</a>, I've been using Komodo IDE for all of my Drupal development for the past 2 weeks and I like it. I know it's some sort of lost geek cred, but function name completion (not just for PHP functions, but Drupal internal functions as well!), integrated debugging and all that stuff really can make your life easier when it's working well.</p>
<p>But, naturally, wouldn't be a blog post if I didn't have a gripe or two - although these ones are minimal. So dear lazyweb:</p>
<p>I love the 'open/find toolbar' - but I can't for the life of me find a keyboard shortcut to focus the open file box there. (i.e. ctrl-i works for the find part, but what's the equivalent for the "open" box?). The one adjustment in moving from emacs is actually having to use a mouse. :(</p>
<p>The other one I actually <a href="http://community.activestate.com/forum-topic/svn-and-cvs-metafiles-con">asked in the support forum</a> (which runs drupal, of course), but the issue is for all of my client work I have drupal checkouts from CVS managed in subversion repositories. I actually, in these cases, would like Komodo to ignore the CVS meta-files and treat the project as using SVN. Any hints?</p>
<p>Anyway, Shane, Jeff and the whole Komodo crew: I just might be a convert. Congrats on your great work :)</p>
