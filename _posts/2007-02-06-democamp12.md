<p>Despite some rather nasty weather, I managed to make it out (along with over 100 of my good friends) to last night's <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampToronto12">DemoCampToronto12</a>. Personally, I thought this was one of the better events. It helps to start off with some quality demos. I really enjoyed <a href="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/~david.humphrey/">David Humphrey's</a> overview the work his students have been doing with the <a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla project</a>. I had the privilege of meeting David at <a href="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/fsoss/2006/">FSOSS</a>, and love the exposure to free software development and community he's providing for his CS students - take note, <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/">UofT</a>. It was also great to have <a href="http://willpate.org/">Will Pate's</a> overview of <a href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a>, not 'cause I learned anything new about flock, but because it means Will's here (and thanks for dinner Will, it's on me next time!). Kudos also for a good demo from Alec Saunders of <a href="http://iotum.com/">Iotum</a> for their presence app for blackberries - I'd love to give it a shot when you've got series60 suppoort! Oh, and they said the magic word of upcoming XMPP integration :)</p>
<p>To me, however, the best part of last night's event was the general feeling or realization that there is actually a strong community here. Personally, as someone who can't make it out to all the events, I have found the "Always on Unconference" that we've started lately in the torcamp <a href="http://www.skype.com/">skype</a> room as a great way to keep in touch, follow up, etc. However, as a relentless advocate for free software and open protocols and standards, I urge the community go pop in to either the #torcamp irc channel or the <a href="xmpp:torcamp@conference.walkah.net?join">xmpp group chat</a> - you can find me in both :) Looking forward to the next event!</p>
