<p>
it seems that everyone i know that knows what the hell <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">gmail</a> is, either already has an account or doesn't want one. (it's nice, since i provide mail service for most of my family, that they're happy enough to stay put). so, for the longest time i've had <a href="http://walkah.net/node/98">unused invitations</a> . it seems that every time i actually manage to get rid of one, they top me up with more.

but now, i have a solution! the super folks over at <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/">spread firefox</a> are doing some promotion with gmail invites, and have a nice new system for <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=node/view/1701">donating gmail invitations</a>. so, i just donated the 5 i had kicking around. i feel much better now. oh and, if you haven't yet...
