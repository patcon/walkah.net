<p>Well, I must say... 30 is off to a great start. I have spent this birthday week feeling overwhelmed by love and support. Thanks to everyone involved :) To cap what is has been an utterly fantastic week, I'm now the proud new owner of a shiny <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">macbook pro</a>. Check a huge one off the ol' wishlist. I'm excited - *very* excited - to be in the land of intel. <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> here I come!</p>

<p>First impressions? Um, this thing is fast. So much faster than anything I've owned so far. Wow.</p>

<p>So, like any self-respecting geek.. I belaboured the machine naming process and finally settled on "mingus" (yes after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mingus">Jazz great</a>). Let the games begin!</p>
