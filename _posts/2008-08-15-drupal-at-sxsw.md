There's even a <a href="http://drupal.org/node/294523">front page post</a> on drupal.org to bring awareness. A group of us from <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/">Lullabot</a> went last year and we had an absolute blast. If you haven't been, sign up now!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/">panel picker</a> is live and I suggest you *all* vote for <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1726">Drupal with Its Pants Off</a> (you know you wanna). What's really exciting, though, is the long list of <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/index/3/q:drupal">other Drupal panels</a> on the list.</p>
<p>Looks like there'll be lots of Drupal in Austin next March... even http://sxsw.com/ is Drupal powered!</p>
<p>My hotel is booked. See you there!</p>
