<p><img src="http://walkah.net/sites/walkah.net/files/mesh-logo.gif" alt="Mesh Conference 2008" />I'm looking forward to hanging out at <a href="http://www.meshconference.com/">Mesh 2008</a> the next couple days. I've had to miss it for various reasons the first two years, so I can't wait to see what all the buzz is about! Watching the talk on <a href="http://hashtags.org/tag/meshu/">twitter</a> today about <a href="http://www.meshconference.com/meshu/">MeshU</a> has gone well and things are off to a great start.</p>
<p>As usual, I'll be the one decked out in <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/">Lullabot</a> gear talking about <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. Hope to see you there :)</p>
