the walkah clan officially kicked off our holiday season this past weekend, with our annual head out and cut down a tree family event on saturday. as is our custom (well, really it's my in-laws custom, i've just adopted it), we gorged ourselves on my mother-in-law's homemade chili for most of the rest of the day saturday. we kept the spirit going yesterday by actually setting up the tree, getting it decorated, and i even finally got around to putting up our lights outside - since it was a beautiful day.
