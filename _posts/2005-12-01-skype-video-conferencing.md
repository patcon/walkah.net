<p>man. looks like <a href="http://skype.com/">skype</a> has announced today a <a href="http://skype.com/products/skype/windows/downloading_beta.html">new beta</a> version (for windows only) that supports video conferencing.</p>

<p>*sigh* yup, windows only. *sigh* yup, still all proprietary.</p>

<p>but, dammit. free, and probably just works. man, i hope there's an xmpp-based free alternative that can catch 'em. until then, now i'm really tempted to rebuild a windows box. *or* i could just wait for the os x release ;)</p>
