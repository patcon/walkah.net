<p>had a very unfortunate end to my workday yesterday. i was downtown, and as usual rode the <a href="http://www.gotransit.com/">go train</a> home.  as we were approaching the aurora station, our train suddenly came to a halt. there was little information given to us passengers on the train other than there had been a "railroad crossing accident".</p>

<p>looking through the headlines this morning, it appears "accident" was a typical official euphemism. in reality, <a href="http://www.thestar.ca/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;call_pageid=971358637177&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1077059708152">two people were killed</a>. i feel awful :(</p>
