for the geekier portion of my audience you will have already seen the news <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/02/1441242">here</a>, but to the rest of you: <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#38;cid=74&#38;e=3&#38;u=/cmp/20040702/tc_cmp/22103407">U.S. Steers Consumers Away From IE</a>. that's right, the department of homeland security is advising folks to stop using microsoft's internet explorer. while it's been years since i used IE with any regularity (not actually running windows anywhere in my home), i know most of you do. stop it. stop it now.

allow me to just take this opportunity to recommend <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">firefox</a>:
