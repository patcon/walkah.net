poking through my unread email, i noticed that the <a href="http://www.wirelesstoronto.ca/">wireless toronto</a> project finally launched a website. i was hoping to make a bit more noise about the fact that they were using <a href="http://drupal.org/" title="Drupal Content Management Platform">drupal</a> - but it looks like that is just for the <a href="http://dev.wirelesstoronto.ca/">"dev" site</a>.
</p><p>
my involvement with wireless toronto (like so many great projects) has been virtually none- and really there's a long list of circumstances (including beers with a <a href="http://www.stevesgallery.com/" title="Steve Mansour">couple</a> <a href="http://bopuc.levendis.com/weblog/" title="Boris Anthony">people</a> in Montreal) behind my even being aware of the project.
</p><p>
however, there are some great local people involved in the project, and community wifi access happens to be something I personally have some interest in (despite not actually living *in* Toronto). so, if you're in the area check them out.
</p><p>
i've also had some *very* preliminary talks about working on something akin to <a href="http://www.ilesansfil.org/wiki/WiFiDog/ContentDistributionSystem">WiFiDog</a> based on drupal - more later if anything comes of that.
