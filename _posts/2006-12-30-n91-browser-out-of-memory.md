<p>One of my main reasons for <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/google-reader-ing">switching to google reader</a> was because of the excellent <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/m">mobile interface</a>. However, on my n91 I kept getting <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/archive/t-50476.html">"Out of memory"</a> errors after browsing a few pages. Restarting the phone would make the error go away, but again only for a few pages. Well, that's not cool. But, apparently it's a problem just in the default browser (based on <a href="http://webkit.org/">webkit</a>). While I applaud nokia for using a free, standards-compliant engine for their browser base, I kinda needs something that works.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.operamini.com/">Opera mini</a>. Mini is opera's free mobile browser, and while not open source, it at least works and seems to work quite well. I've never been a huge fan of opera's browser on the desktop, but they're my current mobile browser of choice.</p>
