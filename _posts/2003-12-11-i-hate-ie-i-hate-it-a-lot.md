... on all platforms, all versions. over the past 24 hours, i have wasted waaaay too much time trying to fix and/or work around stupid stupid things that internet explorer does.
first off, there is the <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/msiepng/petition.html">often-discussed</a>, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pngopacity/">frequently-worked-around</a> lack of support for transparent PNG images in IE on windows. silly me, in playing designer on <a href="http://www.sudden-thoughts.com/">sudden thoughts</a>, i made some transparent pngs. they, of course, looked like crap in IE and have since been converted to .gifs :(
then, there is the idiotic CSS wonkiness that was breaking the otherwise elegant dropdown menus at sudden thoughts. (yes those menus are straight ul's - inspired by <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dropdowns">this article</a>)
finally, <a href="http://www.daemon.co.za/">adrian</a> pointed out that my own site was broken in IE... since i'm not sure when. anyway, i redid the css to use all absolute positioning and IE seems to be happy for the moment.
god i wish everyone would just use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">real</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">browsers</a>.
