<p>so, a while back when <a href="http://www.slimp3.com/">slimp3</a> released their 'squeezebox' i said something here about wanting one. well, i didn't get one, but that's ok because i just read that linksys has a <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/040108/lath036_1.html">wireless dvd player</a> in the works... so this is like the other one, only it plays dvds and can even show my photos. plus, i've had fairly good luck with linksys stuff in the past (for soho shtuff).</p>

<p>i've become a <em>complete</em> geek toy consumer. how the hell did that happen? :P</p>
