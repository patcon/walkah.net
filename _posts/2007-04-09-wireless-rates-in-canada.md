<p>Alternatively titled "up yours, Rogers". I've had a post like this brewing for a long while about how completely out of whack wireless rates are in Canada compared to the rest of the world (including, shamefull, the US). I grumble every time I get notice of my most recent <a href="http://www.rogers.com/">Rogers</a>. I'm not a telecom-industry expert, what I know is that my friends in Europe and the US (and even when my brother was in Rwanda!) pay a whole lot less for their mobile phones than I do - a <em>lot</em> less. Well, sure enough, <a href="http://barcamp.org/TorCamp">TorCamper</a> <a href="http://www.thomaspurves.com/">Thomas Purves</a> posted an interesting graph on his Flickr stream clearly illustrating just how.... messed up the situation is:</p>

<p>A picture is worth a thousand words...</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Tom has <a href="http://www.thomaspurves.com/2007/04/09/canada-worse-than-3rd-world-countries-when-it-comes-to-mobile-data-access/">posted more</a> on his site. Depressing, really.</p>
