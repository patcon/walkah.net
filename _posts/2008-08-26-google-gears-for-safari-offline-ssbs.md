I'm really excited about today's (beta) release of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gears-users/browse_thread/thread/36537d4f47c5495c">google gears for safari</a>. Why? because, as I've just tested, but enabling the plugin for safari it makes it available for all of my <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">fluid app</a> Site Specific Browsers (SSB's).

If you pay close attention here, you'll know that I'm a <a href="http://walkah.net/tag/fluidapp">big fan of fluid</a> and the idea of SSB's in general. I use apps for <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> (my current task management / GTD tool) and <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> extensively. Both of these sites support gears already for use offline (read: on airplanes). However, by using Fluid (based on Safari's webkit), I had to forgo gears/offline access. Thus, when traveling, I'd taken to opening a tab in firefox for each of those sites (if I remembered, and as long as I didn't need to otherwise restart firefox, etc).

Well, I just had a wonderful experience. I <a href="http://dl.google.com/gears/current/gears-osx-opt.dmg">downloaded gears for safari</a>, installed it... and instantly all of my fluid instances were gears enabled. Love it!
