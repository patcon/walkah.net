Now, I've wasted a lot of your time here in the past waffling between mail clients... but I've been using thunderbird consistently since the 2.0 betas and I think it might finally stick. Here's why (for me):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Favorite folders: this feature allows you to mark certain folders (email folders, RSS feeds or saved searches) as "favorites" and you can limit the left-hand pane to view only those folders. For me, since I use <a href="http://www.procmail.org/">procmail</a> heavily to sort mailing list traffic, etc. this is a great feature for seeing my most "important" folders.</li>
<li>UI updates: like Firefox 2.0, Thunderbird got some subtle yet very pleasant UI updates - check them out for yourself. I also like the sound of <a href="http://www.twistermc.com/blog/2007/04/10/thunderbird-labels">this hack</a> to make tags look prettier.</li>
<li>Tags: like the old "labels" messages can now have optionally multiple tags. I know after I read GTD I'm going to love this one even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, while not a core feature, I'm very pleased with the new <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/4634">Growl add-on</a> for new message notification (I had been using YAMB before which wasn't optimal.</p>
<p>Still on my wishlist: sender pictures (preferably from LDAP userpicture or mac address book integration) and better offline detection for OS X. Otherwise, I love it.</p>
