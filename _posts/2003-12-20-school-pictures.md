well, andrew is now on christmas holidays, but his teacher gave the parents a pretty neat gift. in addition to having the kids create and decorate cards for their parents, she also put together a cd full of pictures of the class that she'd taken throughout the first half of the year. now, for a geek like me i'd say that's a pretty cool idea. anyway,  i've uploaded the ones that contain andrew to my <a  href="http://gallery.walkah.net/main.php/view/family/andrew">gallery</a>. it's like a sneak peek into his daily routine. kudos to his teacher.
