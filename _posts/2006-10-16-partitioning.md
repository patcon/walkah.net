<p>i have been considering starting a more personal blog for quite sometime. this blog has become much more tech-centric - to the point where i feel reluctant to post lots of personal stories (stuff about the kids, etc) here. however, i've felt lately like i could use an outlet for the goings on in my personal life.</p>
<p>so, i present to you: <a href="http://james.walkah.net/" title="James Walker">james.walkah.net</a>. it won't be for everyone, but if you're family, a friend, or just a fan - check it out. otherwise, stay tuned here for (hopefully more frequent) updates no the geek stuff.</p>
