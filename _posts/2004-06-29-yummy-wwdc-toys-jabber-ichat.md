i've not followed it too terribly closely, but poking around on <a href="http://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a> now that WWDC is underway, reveals some yummy new goodies. first off... i would _really_ like for one of those yummy <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/">23" monitors</a> to show up on my desk for my birthday (accompanied by a <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">dual g5</a> of course).

the interesting bit that i see is in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/">tiger</a> preview. and, from my point of view, it's not <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/safari.html">safari rss</a> - i <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&#38;postid=2872">agree</a> that was semi-inevitable. the cool thing (i think) is that it would appear that the <a href="http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/tiger/"> server piece</a> is shipping with a jabber server! does this mean that tiger's iChat AV will be jabber enabled? now _that_ could be a great boost for jabber adoption.
