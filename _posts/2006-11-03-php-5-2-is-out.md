<p>I don't usually blog much... and certainly not about things like releases of new PHP versions. However, I think it's worth noting that <a href="http://www.php.net/releases/5_2_0.php">php 5.2</a> has been released. From the <a href="http://ilia.ws/archives/142-PHP-5.2.0-is-finally-out!.html">sounds of things</a>, and certainly from my minimal experiments with it, it seems that php 5 may have finally arrived.</p>
<p>Anyone out there running php5 in heavy (large scale) production? Is it time to move beyond the safe "known entity" comforts of php4?</p>
