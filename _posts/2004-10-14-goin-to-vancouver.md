<p>
just a quick note to say... i'm officially booked for my first business trip as a <a href="http://www.bryght.com/">bryght guy</a>. i'll be headed to vancouver at the end of this month (Oct 25th - 30th). it's been a couple months of working together, and finally we can sit down and match faces to voices and email signatures. i'm excited to meet up with <a href="http://www.bryght.com/about/the-team">boris, roland and richard</a> - too bad we couldn't get adrian here for this one :(
</p><p>
also, roland has <a href="http://drupal.org/node/11593">publicly announced</a> that we're gonna have a big meet-up with <a href="http://www.buytaert.net/">dries</a> on the 29th. if you're in the vancouver area on the 29th and have any interest in drupal, come on out! the <a href="http://www.civicspacelabs.org/">civicspace</a> guys are gonna be there too... should be a blast!  i know i owe dries at least a beer or two. :)
