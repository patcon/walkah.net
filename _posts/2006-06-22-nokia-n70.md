<p>i've set a new personal record for most short lived gadget. my last cellphone (the <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/nokia-6620">nokia 6620</a>) has been replaced.</p>

<p>when i first saw that <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/" title="roland tanglao">my favourite member</a> of nokia's blogger outreach program got his hands on the <a href="http://nokia.com/n91">n91</a> i was maybe slightly jealous. however, said jealousy has subsided as i have inherited his former envy-inducing phone: the <a href="http://nokia.com/n70">n70</a>. so i've managed to get all my data synced onto the new phone... but alas haven't had much of a chance to play yet. so, i'll have to report back later on how much like (or i suppose dislike) this fancy little gadget. but, basically it has all the benefits of my last phone plus some sweet bits: like a "real" camera (with lens cover!), a sleeker form factor, and a bunch of pre-installed apps courtesy of roland.</p>

<p>oh, and fear not - my old phone has found a happy home with one of <a href="http://www.sarahpullman.com/" title="sarahfelicity">my favourite</a> <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/nokia-6620#comment-28636">python hackers</a> ;)</p>
