<p>I'm currently sitting at SFO - feeling what I've come to recognize as my "typical" post Drupal (related) conference feeling of utter exhaustion and renewed excitement and energy in the project. I can't even believe how much happened and that we did 2 days of <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/">conference</a>, an all-day <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/seminar/drupal_performance_and_scalability/sunnyvale_ca_2007">seminar </a> and an all-day <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/node/33">hackfest</a> already. What a whirlwind.</p>
<p>For those unable to attend, we missed you! You can check out <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/oscms2007">the flickr photos</a> as well as <a href="http://drupal.org/events/oscms2007">drupal.org's events section</a> for slides, notes and recaps (where I'll be posting my things likely tomorrow when I'm home again). Hopefully we'll see you at a future event!</p>
<p>To those of you there - thanks a whole lot for making it such a great event and a rockin' community. It was great seeing everyone I hadn't seen in a while and nice putting some new faces to names. See you all soon!</p>
