<p>
it's finally been <a href="http://drupal.org/node/11696">officially released</a> into the wild. i must say, it's by <strong>far</strong> the best drupal release yet. and things are looking great moving forward. here's to a job well done (Dries - you'll get your beer(s) in about 10 days :) )
</p><p>
i've intended for a while to write up some of my personal goals for the next release, but just haven't gotten that far yet. soon.
</p><p>
<strong>UPDATE:</strong> of course,  as soon as i hit "post" <a href="http://www.acko.net">UnConeD</a> took the wraps off his new theme "bluebeach".  i'd have to argue that now <a href="http://drupal.org/">drupal.org</a> is one of the best looking drupal sites :)
