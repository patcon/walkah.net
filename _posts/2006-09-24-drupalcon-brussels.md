<p>that was fast, but somehow in the past 72 hours the latest <a href="http://drupalcon.org/">DrupalCon</a> has come and gone here in Brussels. as usual the event was a blast, the <a href="http://www.saplounge.be/">venue</a> was great, and as usual it was so good to catch up with all the great drupal people around the world - and to meet some new ones. thanks <a href="http://buytaert.net/">dries</a> and <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/">boris</a> for everything you did to help put it together.</p>

<p>so, i wanted to quickly post my slides from the two "official" talks I gave:</p>

<p><a href="http://drupalcon.org/node/28">Module development tutorial: pants module</a> - This was arguably the most fun I've had doing a presentation ever. I got some great feedback, and maybe (just maybe) will give at least a version again in the future. grab the <a href="http://walkah.net/files/pants-module.pdf">PDF</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://drupalcon.org/node/27">Files and Multimedia</a> - another take on a talk I've given a couple times now... always a good one. there's always a new idea or two about how media should be handled. grab the <a href="http://walkah.net/files/files-multimedia.pdf" >PDF</a>.</p>

<p>rumour has it there is video coming as well. stay tuned.</p>
