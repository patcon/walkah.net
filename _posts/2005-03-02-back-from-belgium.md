the first ever <a href="http://drupal.org" title="drupal content management platform">drupal</a> conference is over and i'm home safe and sound.
</p><p>
i've actually been home for nearly 48 hours, but it's taken me until now to sort through all the pictures, get them online, and shake off some jet lag. overall, i had an awesome time. I've put up a ton of pictures both from <a href="http://walkah.net/gallery/v/travels/europe2005/paris/" title="Paris gallery">paris</a> as well as stuff from <a href="http://walkah.net/gallery/v/travels/europe2005/drupalcon2005/" title="drupalcon / belgium pictures">belgium</a>. there is <a href="http://drupal.org/node/17995#new" title="Drupal conference update">a post on drupal.org</a> with a brief recap, and links to other's pictures.
</p><p>
obviously, i didn't take many pictures of me... my current favourite though is this one from <a href="http://www.buytaert.net/" title="Drupal conference update">dries</a> (the caption is the best):

<br />"James walker prays to druplicon."
<br />
<br />lots of great ideas came out of the code sprints... if even half of it all gets implemented for drupal 4.7 it's gonna rock. i'd say more, but i need to start writing code ;)
