<p>Summer is coming - which means it's time for Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Summer of Code</a>. This is the fourth year of the project (and the fourth year that <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> has been involved). We continue to be one of Google's favourite <a href="http://drupal.org/node/249455">open source projects</a> this year grabbing 21 spots - which means a $105,000 investment in Drupal development this summer!</p>

<p>I'm excited as this will be my third year as a mentor and my project this year will be <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/drupal/appinfo.html?csaid=38C7A068DBDDD3D7">OpenID Attribute Exchange</a> support for Drupal. <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-attribute-exchange-1_0.html">Attribute Exchange</a> is one of the next important pieces in digital identity and one that I'm pretty excited about. My student, <a href="http://anshprat.wordpress.com/">Anshu Prateek</a>, has shown a lot of enthusiasm. I think it's gonna be a good summer!</p>
