[![Using Drupal](http://walkah.net/sites/walkah.net/files/using_drupal.png)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fo%2FASIN%2F0596515804&tag=drupal0a-20&link)In my usual heard-it-hear-last style... I was out to dinner this week with my friend, [Phillip](http://www.communitybandwidth.ca/), who was apparently unaware that [Lullabot](http://www.lullabot.com/) had written a book(?!?) and I was one of the authors.

Well, for most of last year (plus) most of us over at lullabot spent sleepless nights putting together [Using Drupal](http://www.usingdrupal.com/). It went to press in early December, and is indeed [on amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fo%2FASIN%2F0596515804&tag=drupal0a-20&link) and even [on shelves](http://flickr.com/photos/add1sun/3168949626/).

I'm personally pretty proud of the book. It's the first Drupal book by [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/) and the first to take a comprehensive look at building a "real" Drupal site with heavy emphasis on CCK, Views and the rest of drupal contrib.

I have to say, too, that O'Reilly was a lot of fun to work with. There's a reason they have a reputation for having the top tech books. If you missed it, @eaton and I did a [live webcast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ04xTyx6yo) with O'Reilly which was their biggest ever. Kool-aid for everyone!

If you don't have a copy yet, what's wrong with you? ;-)
