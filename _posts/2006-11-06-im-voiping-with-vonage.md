<p>Last week, after getting smacked by a nasty bill from my good friends at <a href="http://rogers.com/">rogers</a>, I chatted with <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/">Boris</a> briefly and decided to sign up for a <a href="http://vonage.ca/">vonage line</a>. Well, late this afternoon my equipment arrived! In just works(tm) fashion, I plugged in the little D-Link device and I was making calls. $40/month unlimited calling in north america, here I come!</p>
<p>Now I have to figure out a handset. I want a bluetooth enabled handset that syncs with my addressbook and will pause iTunes while I'm on the phone... is that too much to ask?</p>
