in my typical a-bit-too-late-to-the-party fashion, i actually broke down and accepted an offer for a <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">gmail</a> account (thanks <a href="http://www.menalto.com/bharat/">bharat</a>!). for those of you that don't know, gmail is google's free webmail service (boasting features like 1gb of free email space and google search power for your inbox). it's currently in beta - and (much like orkut) is still by invite only.  i noticed today i happen to have a couple of said invites - feel free to drop me a line if you are interested.

oh, and of course, i am <a href="mailto:walkah@gmail.com">walkah@gmail.com</a> (duh).
