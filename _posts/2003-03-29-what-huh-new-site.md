<p>ok... i've been really quiet again. but now i'm back and things have changed. i've redone my site as a <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">drupal</a> site. This means, amongst other things, that i have a decent way to maintain the site above and beyond my normal method. *hopefully* this will result in more frequent posts.  but, more importantly, it means that i can take advantage of neat features that other people have written without re-writing them myself.  as cool as it is to do that... i've got other things to do.</p>

<p>2 things that I haven't yet incorporated into drupal are:</p>

<ol>

<li>my pictures... drupal has an "image" module... but converting things is more of a hassle that i'm into right now... but all the pictures are still available in the same old place (linked above)</li>

<li>my file downloads... since most of these are just symlinks to my actual config files, that's much easier for me to maintain outside of drupal.

</ol>



<p>Long story short... come on in... heck sign up for an account... make comments... get involved. yay.</p>
