My little brother, [Chad](http://twitter.com/chuckyd4), and the awesome [Elisa](http://twitter.com/lisawithane) got married this past weekend. It was an amazing weekend by the sea in Rockport - the weather was great, the food was incredible and I had a wonderful time.

Since my whole clan was in the wedding (Camryn was flower girl, Andrew a groomsman, and I was best man), I decided to rent a "real camera"(tm) for the weekend to capture the experience. It was my first time really experimenting with a nice camera. I'm glad I did! I had a lot of fun. Check out the results on flickr:

Feedback welcome - especially from you real photographers out there. Now to start filling my piggy bank for a real camera...
