<p>according to <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2005/11/20051118094605.shtml">mac rumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
The update appears to only offer stability improvements and no major new features. The newest update reportedly includes checks to make sure that the user is running on the iMac G5, which is presently the only supported configuration. Front Row is only available by purchasing the new iMac G5 with built in iSight.

<p>i'm not sure i understand apple's whole idea behind this. why cripple it on non iMacs? there is clearly a market for this on other systems (i'm not the only one with a mac mini dying for front row).</p>
<p>anyone have any more information about the new version on non imacs?</p>
