<img src="http://walkah.net/files/DCP_1390.JPG" height="133" width="200" alt="DCP_1390" align="right" />quite some time ago, i came into the possession of a 3com audrey. for those of you that have never heard of an audrey: audrey is a failed "internet appliance" discontinued by 3com a couple years ago. full specs on audrey can be seen <a href="http://www.canoma.com/audrey/specs.html">here</a>. the cool part about these gadget, is that they run a stripped down version of <a href="http://www.qnx.com">qnx</a> - and, as it turns out, they are <a href="http://www.audreyhacking.com/">very hackable</a>.

so, i've finally set mine up and gone through <a href="http://www.3rdmoon.com/crusso/audrey/initialsetup/updateaudrey.htm">these instructions</a> to get a root shell. let the hacking begin!

my first task, is that i wanted to use audrey as a digital photo frame - i.e. have it rotate through a bunch of my digital images (stored on my fileserver). after some digging (and disappointment that many projects seem to have disappeared), i came across <a href="http://bloodyeck.com/projects/audrey/">this site</a>.  after some struggling with it (thanks for your help alex!) i managed to get it working the way i wanted. you can almost see the results in the attached photo.

i'll continue to log any further hacks <a href="/tag/audrey">here</a>.
