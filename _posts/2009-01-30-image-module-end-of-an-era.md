A few weeks ago, I very quietly made a (personally) significant move in my Drupal life. I "officially" transferred the project ownership of the [drupal image module](http://drupal.org/project/image) to [Daniel "sun" Kudwien](http://drupal.org/user/54136). Truth be told, I haven't been the primary maintainer of the module for over a year. That job has been admirably handled by [drewish](http://drupal.org/user/34869). However, both drewish and I have a lot else on our plates and one of Drupal's [most used](http://drupal.org/project/usage) modules has not gotten the focused attention it deserves.

Now, as Angie will [tell you](http://webchick.net/contributor-spotlight/daniel-kudwien), Daniel is a fantastic Drupal contributor - worthy of the praise he receives. But, I'd like to give a personal shout out: he has helped to take the [image issue queue](http://drupal.org/project/issues/image) from over 12 pages long down to 3.

Nice work, sun. The community thanks you :-)
