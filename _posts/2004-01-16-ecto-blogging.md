i think i may have found my new blogging tool of choice (for mac os x anyway). this post it brought to you by <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/">ecto</a> ... the next generation of the now defunct 'kung log'. though it's still in beta, it looks promising. the UI is fairly pleasant, and it's already pretty chock full of features. it also appears to support metaWeblogAPI's file upload... so now i will have a non-windows way to test <a href="http://drupal.org/node/view/4878">this feature</a>.
