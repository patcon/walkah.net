So, it looks like <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1062" id="1062">the rumours</a> that started yesterday about <a href="http://www.apple.com/">apple</a>'s latest version of iTunes ( 4.8 ) supporting video <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2005/05/20050509215340.shtml">are true. </a> Apple's iTunes Music Store is now selling videos (as well as music). But here's the best part (from <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2005/05/20050509215340.shtml">macrumors.com </a>):
</p><blockquote>
These videos are simply animated shorts rather than music videos - and in this particular instance - do not utilize any Digital Rights Management.
</blockquote><p>
One would have to think that this is a first step in a move toward distributing movies, etc, via iTunes - which makes the often rumoured 'iHome' machine look much more probable.

It's also one more reason for me to re-consider picking up a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">mac mini</a> for the living room. I've sold Sandi on the beauty of <a href="http://www.btefnet.net/">tv torrents</a> - but the dance i do to hook my powerbook up to the TV is less than ideal, and means that my powerbook has to be available.... ah, if only money grew on trees.
