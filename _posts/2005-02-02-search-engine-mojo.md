as you may have heard, MSFT has finally launched <a href="http://search.msn.com/">msn search</a> - their attempt to take on google. so, what better way to test than a little "vanity searching". now, i've owned the market on searches for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=walkah">walkah</a>" for quite some time. but, when it comes to googling for "<a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22James+Walker%22">James Walker</a>", while i tend to land on page one - i'm not #1. :(

however, msn might have something right... according to Microsoft, I'm the most important "<a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?noredir=1&q=%22James+Walker%22">James Walker</a>" on the internet. that's awful sweet of them. not bad for a guy with a rather generic name. ;)
