so, i had an awesome night last night. a new friend of ours was able to score gold tickets -- row 11!!! -- to last night's leafs / flyers game. we lost 3-2 in triple-OT ... which stunk. but what fun! and, since we were there for 2 games worth of hockey, i don't feel quite as bad about paying way too much :)

unfortunately, the bruins just finished their season's tailspin... getting eliminated by the devils :(

TOR 2 - PHI - 2

BOS 1 - NJ 4 :(
