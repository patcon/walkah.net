so, lately in my "spare" time (i.e. the wee hours of the morning), i've been helping my brother, chad, launch a little website he calls <a href="http://www.sudden-thoughts.com/">sudden thoughts</a>.  
for those of you who don't know, chad is a brilliant writer and a total music nerd.  sudden thoughts is a showcase of both of these attributes. the site currently features cd reviews (focus on lesser-known jazz & hip-hop), in depth coverage of up and coming labels and a neat feature in which artists are contributing their own 'view from the trenches' - the first of which was contributed by <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;uid=UIDCASS70312021700042613&amp;sql=B7267gjirj6ix">steve coleman</a>.
i encourage everyone to check it out!
&lt;plug&gt; i did all the design and coding behind the site using (of course) <a href="http://drupal.org">drupal</a>&lt;/plug&gt;  ;)
