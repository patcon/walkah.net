<p>Congrats, guys! This is exciting... Jaiku, for those of you who don't know, is like <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a> (and if you don't know twitter... well SHEESH!) as a system for providing "updates" - or "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-blogging">microblogging</a>" - only cooler. It also happens to be where two of my smartest friends <a href="http://term.ie/blog/">termie</a> and <a href="http://ralphm.net/blog/">ralphm</a> work. Jaiku, amongst other cool things, has bit better concept of 'presense' than twitter and are doing some cool work with <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> on the backend.</p>
<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2007/10/09/google-buys-jaiku/">Early speculation</a> as to what GOOG has in mind for Jaiku is just that... early speculation. I'll be anxiously waiting to see what comes from the acquisition. In the meantime, as a happy side-effect, <a href="http://term.ie/blog/haayoaalio-ala-lyo/">Andy is moving back to SF</a>... can't wait for our next adventures in California :)</p>
