so, much like some <a href="http://boris.bmannconsulting.com/">friends</a> of <a href="http://www.jluster.org/">mine</a>, i've been playing a bit with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a> lately. it's a really cool service, with lots of neat <a href="http://www.flash.com/">flash</a>-based gizmos - but for those of you that don't know, essentially flickr is a place to store photos and share them with your friends and family.

what's really cool is it seems like they add new features almost faster than i can keep up with. you can include a feed of your latest flickr photos on your own site (as I've done over there --&gt;). but another really cool trick is annotating pictures. to play around with it, i uploaded a random shot of my desk (with all my little geek toys on display - amongst the mess). well, almost as quickly as i'd gotten <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo.gne?id=80233">this picture</a> online, <a href="http://boris.bmannconsulting.com/">boris</a> had marked up all the interesting bits on my desk.

pretty sweet.
