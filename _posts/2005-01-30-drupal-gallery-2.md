so, here's a public announcement to all those of you who have been emailing me and waiting patiently: the drupal module for integrating gallery2 is out in the wild. you can get it from either the <a href="http://cvs.drupal.org/viewcvs/drupal/contributions/modules/gallery/">drupal cvs repository</a> <em>or</em> the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/gallery/integration/gallery2/drupal">gallery cvs repository</a>. one thing to note:
</p><p>
<strong>this is beta software</strong>
</p><p>
:) it may or may not work in your setup or environment. however, those of you that pay close enough attention will have noticed that i've been using the module for a while to run my gallery here. i must say, i like it.
</p><p>
there are some cool features that you just don't get <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" title="Flickr photo management">other places</a>. for example check out my <a href="http://walkah.net/gallery/v/cam.html" title="walkah web cam">webcam</a> , or check out a <a href="http://walkah.net/gallery/v/video/" title="gallery2 video handling">video</a> - yep auto generated thumbnails!
</p><p>
so, those of you that are interested, grab the code, give it a whirl. please, direct any bugs, features, etc to the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/gallery">drupal project page</a>.
