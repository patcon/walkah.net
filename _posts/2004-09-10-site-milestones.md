right on the heels of drupal.org getting it's <a href="http://drupal.org/node/view/10000">10,000th node</a>, a couple of sites that are close to my heart have reached major milestones as well. ok, so it wasn't really <em>right</em> on the heels - it has been nearly a month, but still:

<a href="http://www.terminus1525.ca/">terminus1525.ca</a> now as its <a href="http://www.terminus1525.ca/node/view/10000">10,000th node</a>!
</p><p>
wait! there's more! following my post yesterday, this humble little site now has <a href="http://walkah.net/node/100">100 nodes</a>!
<br />(OK, that's not very exciting. I lied).
