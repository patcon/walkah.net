<p>As mentioned by <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/openid-mashpit-in-vancouver">Boris</a>, I'm headed to Vancouver this week to take part in the <a href="http://mashpit.pbwiki.com/MashPitOpenidVancouver">OpenID Mashpit</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.sxip.com/">SXIP</a>. Yes, it's true I'll be showing off some Drupal OpenID code that I've been working on (along with <a href="http://drupal.org/user/20129">Rowan Kerr</a> who deserves a ton of credit). I'm pretty excited about it... I feel like I've been working on identity-related code for lots of years now (like 2!) so it'll be nice to get to hang out with others "in the field".</p>
<p>If you're not already on the list (and in the Vancouver area), come on out!</a>
