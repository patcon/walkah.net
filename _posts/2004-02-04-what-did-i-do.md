<p>for the first time in quite sometime (perhaps ever) i actually bought a piece of "shareware" (or otherwise low-cost software). i think having my powerbook is really starting to do odd things to my brain. anyway, the story is that my beta release of <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/">ecto</a> expired (since the final version was released). *however* i didn't buy ecto. instead, i decided to buy <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/netnewswire/">netnewswire</a> instead. why? well, because i've become completely addicted to reading a bunch of RSS feeds in the morning (it's replaced my previous habit of <a href="http://slashdot.org/">slashdot reading</a>) and the full version of netnewswire also has a built-in blog poster (plus more options for news reading). so, i decided if i'm gonna buy something, might as well buy one that does both. </p>
<p>i do like some features of ecto and would recommend it for those interested. however, now that  i'm a paying customer, i'll see if i can get netnewswire to bolster it's blog poster.</p>
<p>to the author of netnewswire: congrats on some mighty fine work!</p>
