# Contributing

I am actively welcoming contributions to my personal blog in a few ways:

## Post Ideas

If there's something you'd like to hear my thoughts on (sounds crazy, but it [already happened](https://github.com/walkah/walkah.net/issues/11)), then please submit an issue and label it `idea`:

https://github.com/walkah/walkah.net/issues/new

You can also view my current upcoming post ideas here:

https://github.com/walkah/walkah.net/labels/idea

All new posts will be done as pull requests. Reviews and edits greatly appreciated:

https://github.com/walkah/walkah.net/pulls

## Patches welcome

I'll happily accept patches for typos, edits or factual corrections. To do so, please fork and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/walkah/walkah.net/compare).
